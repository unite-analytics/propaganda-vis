As a bonus, the project qualified for a nice rebate under LADWP’s Turf Removal Program.”\n\nAfter digging up their front lawn, sketching out a site plan, and securing plants and materials -- all with guidance from Surfrider -- Laura and her family invited friends, family, and community members to participate in a Garden Assistance Party at their home, led by landscape professionals with Surfrider's West LA-Malibu Chapter. In less than six hours, participants transformed the site. They learned how to create berms and swales for visual interest and rainwater retention, planted more than 50 climate-friendly plants, and applied compost tea and mulch to build soil health, reduce watering needs, and retard weeds.\n\n“It’s astonishing how quickly the space was converted from blah to beautiful,” said Laura. “Now we look forward to stepping out our front door each morning. And the bees are happy too! We are so appreciative to Surfrider and the Palisades community for their support!”","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-03-09T15:30:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:10:49.746883","geo":{"coords":[-118.544779,34.084525],"addressComponents":{"adminArea4":"Los Angeles Co.","adminArea3":"CA","formattedAddress":"Los Angeles, CA","adminArea5":"Los Angeles","adminArea1":"United States"}},"id":"9iD_XljeRCqMslDYP59PUg","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:41:37.738464"},{"remoteID":"27563-147","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Lawful Rebellion"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Occupy Camps!"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"Just me","content":"Just me, tried to follow the link to here from UK column a few weeks ago, but it said 'you do not have the necessary permission' or some such.

A media-sharing platform called Before It’s News, which allows registered users to post current events and commentary, added the video on February 28. The Syrian Free Press Network refers to itself as a collection of freelance reporters “for the truth, for Syria; for evidence of conspiracy against Syria,” A page linked to their website clarifies their stance as staunchly pro-regime.\n\nThe segment of the news clip that addresses the alleged attacks begins approximately eight minutes in, with a statement by the newscaster that “terrorist Hassam Ali Bakkour confessed to taking part in acts of abduction, rape, and slaughter along with a terrorist group in Homs, in addition to joining Al-Qaeda in Iraq.” \n\nThe newscaster notes that the featured confession first aired on “Syrian TV,” meaning the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA). SANA is a privately owned but “semi-official” source known for its loyalty to the regime. Footage of this original clip is shown without sound, and the Syrian Free Press Network’s recap is in English: \n\n“…Bakkour said that he entered Iraq illegally and joined a group of 200 gunmen from Al-Qaeda in Baghdad, where they participated in terrorist operations for nine days before being told that their work was over and they should return to Syria. He said that he was instructed to abduct four young women from Baba Amr, so he went to where they lived along with four other gunmen, abducted them, and took them to a basement near the roundabout in Baba Amr where they blindfolded them and left them there, only to return the next day and rape them and, later, kill them. He said that afterward, they abducted 10 citizens from various areas in Homs and took them to the same basement and slit their throats in a similar manner.”\n\nThe date of the alleged rapes is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-02-28T19:22:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:09:11.259483","geo":{"coords":[36.687632,34.709052],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"Syria","formattedAddress":"Syria"}},"id":"WWa0aaDRTX2t7H6Q8b1Jpg","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:24:15.723695"},{"remoteID":"34369-170","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"2OF.

The clip, which was posted to YouTube by a Nora News account on February 9, features interviews by a man named Yassin Ali with Syrian human rights activists and a number of other professionals in the field. The channel, which describes itself as \"independent\" on its Facebook page, says it aims \"to be a free voice for all Syrians of all affiliations, and to be a truthful image for every inch of Syrian territory.\" \n\nSamah Al-Hadi, an activist and journalist, is the first to speak, her face obscured by dim lighting to protect her identity. “Nobody can follow up on this issue,” she says, referring to the difficulties faced by those seeking to document rape. \n\n“I heard about a young girl, 13 or 14 years old, who got raped in Reef Damascus [the countryside]. I tried to reach her, to understand the truth and how it happened. I heard she was with her parents and they were stopped at a roadblock by the regime forces. Something provoked the father and he spoke rudely to them. As revenge, they took the girl out of the car and went out of sight for a while. When they came back she was crying. \n\n“I had difficulty finding the family. When her relatives and acquaintances found out I was a journalist and that I document similar cases, they worked hard to prevent me from meeting her so that I would not shame her. When I was able to reach the mother and introduce myself, she told the father who I was. He immediately kicked me out of the house. He was in a very difficult mental state. He kept telling me, ‘No girl here was raped,’ and then he wept. That is how much emotional stress he was under. He is a wounded father. I respected his wish and left.” \n\nA writer named Nawal Al-Sibai says she faced similar struggles when she reported from the city where the revolution began. “It was handled wrong from the beginning, when children in Daraa were raped. I was the only one who dared, after three months, to write about the mutilation and cutting off of the genitalia of one child.” \n\nMany of the women discussed the pervasiveness of regime-perpetrated sexualized violence in Syria. Al-Sibai says: “The rape of women is like the rape of men: both are crimes.” Both of these crimes have been “taking place in the Ba’ath regimes in Syria and Iraq, in a systematic way, for the last 50 years.” \n\nWhen asked if rapes were occurring during home raids, Al-Hadi says the groups that make up the regime’s forces are not all the same. “Homes are being raided and searched,” she says. “Nobody can predict what other things can happen too.” \n\n“Syria is a big prison,” she says. Some of the government forces “are prepared psychologically, trained and sometimes chosen from a specific sect, to carry out these atrocities. The same thing for slaughtering with knives, executing unarmed civilians, killing little children, or crushing skulls with a machete or an axe.” \n\nShe tells the story of Rasha Alabd, an emergency technician in Duma, who she says was caring for the wounded in a house. Every inhabitant, including Alabd’s family, she says, was killed. She describes seeing Alabd’s head crushed in with what she believes were axes belonging to government forces.\n\nSabah says she also knows of a 50-year-old woman who was groped and patted down when men raided her home. \n\nHuman rights activist Jud Attar relates another story: “A young activist from the Alawite sect was approached by a very close male friend who claimed he wanted to defect. She believed him and accompanied him to a civilian office where he threatened to turn her in if she resisted his sexual advances. He said, ‘Would you rather go to prison where you will be tortured, raped repeatedly and maybe even killed?’” The woman says that in this instance, the “psychological and emotional trauma was huge,\" but does not specify if and how she was sexually assaulted.\n\nThe program stresses that the suffering of the survivors is compounded by the traditional belief system that prizes purity. Abdullah Almoussi, a member of the Syrian Student Association, cites the rarity with which a victim of rape, or her family, will report the incident. In most cases the reason they don’t report is the “dominant culture that dwells on protecting the girls’ and the families’ reputations.” \n\nAl-Sibai argues that victim-shaming is in part caused by a societal conflation of rape and adultery, and that we must distinguish between the two. “Rape is a crime committed by an individual with power, towards a weaker victim who is refusing to submit, in order to break the victim’s will and humiliate her,” she says. “Adultery is a sin between an individual and his Lord and creator.”\n\nShe goes on to say: “Those women did not choose to have this happen. They protected their honor. They are princesses of purity. Real honor is in your actions, according to Messenger Muhammad. There is no honor killing in Islam, and whoever commits that is a criminal himself.” \n\nA Syrian doctor who asked to remain anonymous explains that she is using experiences gained from the Bosnian war, in which an estimated 50,000-60,000 women were raped, to treat survivors of rape. “We help with shelter so the victim can feel human again,” she says, “and we let her speak on her own without pressuring her. She needs to feel secure.” \n\nA voiceover describes how victims of sexualized violence are tormented by the silence within Syrian society and at the international level. \n\nIn her final words, Al-Sibai says: “Honor does not go away if the body is attacked and insulted forcefully. The real honor is the ability of the society to wake up and protect its men and women from such crimes.” \n\nThe remainder of the clip contains part of a video WMC’s Women Under Siege has previously posted to this map. It features a former prisoner of the regime who attests to the rape of a 16-year-old girl being held in the same prison, and ends with a slogan of defiance written across the screen: “The Syrian women will remain the icon of the revolution that gave the father martyrdom, the brother martyrdom and the son martyrdom.” \n\nThe dates and exact locations of the reported acts of sexualized violence are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-02-13T08:53:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:09:11.045642","geo":{"coords":[36.3064,33.5111],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"Syria","formattedAddress":"Damascus, Syria","adminArea5":"Damascus"}},"id":"KyHxxR2xTkOnHguC7X5eeA","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:24:25.223766"},{"remoteID":"3691-375","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"česky, čeština","code":"cs","name":"Czech"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Praha sociální­"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Praha občanská"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"Město chystá vystěhovat Střední průmyslovou školu elektrotechnickou V Úžlabině","content":"<p style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: medium; text-align: left;\">V pátek 8. února 2013 bylo vedení střední školy SPŠE v Malešicích náhle a bez předchozího varování velmi nestandardním způsobem informováno svým zřizovatelem o záměru SPŠE, která je dlouhodobě považována za jednu z nejlepších technických středních škol v Praze, spojit s jinou pražskou školou, konkrétně s učelištěm na Jesenické. Jako důvod byla uvedena nákladnost provozu školy a skutečnost, že kapacita školy není využita na 100 %. Škola přitom v posledních letech prošla rozsáhlými a finančně nákladnými rekonstrukcemi, renovacemi a modernizací některých specializovaných učeben. Investiční náklady ve výši dvou milionů přitom byly spolufinancovány pražským magistrátem.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: medium; text-align: left;\">Vedení a studenti SPŠE, která je mimo jiné fakultní školou ČVUT, mají obavu z nákladnosti a obtížnosti stěhování vysoce specializovaného vybavení školy, jakož i z komplikovanosti či dokonce nemožnosti sloučení zaměření a oborů obou škol.

Je pravděpodobné, že nemovitost, která se nachází na lukrativní místě s výhledem na město a v těsné blízkosti nového developerského projektu ByTy Malešice, může být prodána a následně přestavěna pro zcela jiné, pravděpodobně komerční účely. V situaci, kdy v lokalitě neustále dochází k navyšování residenční kapacity, lze plán na vystěhování kvalitní školy považovat za nevhodný nejen z hlediska funkčního využítí této obytné čtvrti, ale především i z důvodu netransparentnosti a nestandardnosti postupu magistrátních úředníků. V neposlední řadě je na místě obava z budoucího využití budovy, které dosud není známé.

The task force said the women had taken cover in a shelter while the men fled to avoid capture during a raid. They were held there for two days and repeatedly gang-raped, the task force said.\n\nTask force members said they know a few of the women in this case and that one, an 18- or 19-year-old, was forced to marry her cousin as a result. Her husband told the task force that “nothing happened to her,” but a psychologist who had treated the woman said that she was raped in the incident.

One that featured in the <i>Nostoi</i> exhibition (no. 39) was a Greek text on lead sheets now displayed in the Museo Civico in Castelvetrano in Sicily. The text is a <i>lex sacra </i>linked to cults at the Greek colony of Selinus in south-western Sicily.<br />\n<br />\nThe lead sheet was acquired by the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1981, deaccessioned in 1991, and returned to Italy in 1992. Shortly afterwards the text was published by M.H. Jameson, D.R. Jordan and R.D. Kotansky in <i>A Lex Sacra from Selinous</i> (Greek, Roman and Byzantine monographs 11; Duke University, 1993). John Walsh explained that as \"the Getty Museum does not exhibit material of primarily historical interest, we concluded that the piece would be better returned to Italy\". Walsh also affirmed the \"importance\" of the inscription \"for further study and interpretation of the site of ancient Selinous\".<br />\n<br />\nJason Felch and Ralph Frammolino mention the return (<i>Chasing Aphrodite</i>, 118-19):<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe Lex Sacra ... was inscribed with instructions for a religious ritual and had been traced to a sanctuary of Demeter near ... Selinunte. Despite the tablet's historical significance, the Getty had never taken it out of storage because it was not deemed beautiful enough for public display. Now, without any prompting, the cirator was willing to give it back.</blockquote>\nThey place the return in the wake of the October 1991 Rome conference where recently surfaced antiquities were discussed.<br />\n<br />\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody>\n<tr><td><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EfF1jKFNi7A/UQwUVps_jrI/AAAAAAAADFo/YYosVeNVBi4/s1600/krater_donkey.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EfF1jKFNi7A/UQwUVps_jrI/AAAAAAAADFo/YYosVeNVBi4/s320/krater_donkey.jpg\" width=\"191\" /></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Detail from bell-krater</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\nThis is not the only inscription on a lead plaque linked to Selinus and acquired by the Getty. \"<a href=\"http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/deciphering-the-getty-hexameters/\">The Getty Hexameters</a>\" tablet was also acquired in 1981 as a gift from Dr Max Gerchik (inv. <a href=\"http://search.getty.edu/museum/records/musobject?objectid=18820\">81.AI.140.2</a>). (The inscription was first loaned in 1980.) The Getty catalogue suggests that it was derived from Selinus. This is one of several lead plaques acquired from Gerchik in 1981 with a Selinus link.<br />\n<br />\nIt is of more than passing interest that Max Gerchik was the donor of an Attic red-figured bell-krater that has also been returned to Italy (inv. 81.AE.149; Gill and Chippindale, no. 15; Nostoi no. 30).<br />\n<br />\nWill the Getty be releasing full details of the collecting histories of these and other Sicilian pieces acquired by the museum? Where did Gerchik acquire them? How long did they reside in his \"collection\"? What is the basis of the Sicilian association?<br />\n<br />\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8972497915033440413\" name=\"data:post.title\"><img alt=\"Bookmark and Share so Your Real Friends Know that You Know\" height=\"16\" src=\"http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/lg-share-en.gif\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\" width=\"125\" /></a>\n</div>\n<!-- AddThis Button END -->","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-02-01T14:18:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:14:19.777958","geo":{"coords":[15.279043,37.07384],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"Italy","streetAddress":"Via Francesco Saverio Cavallari","adminArea3":"Sic.","adminArea4":"SR","adminArea5":"Syracuse","postalCode":"96100","formattedAddress":"Via Francesco Saverio Cavallari, 96100 Syracuse SR"}},"id":"HWN6V4QIQhGB_Bf1Bq5WAQ","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:01:06.148097"},{"remoteID":"27563-137","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Lawful Rebellion"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"otf COLE","content":"Hi.

Workers Strike in Shanghai","content":"From The Huffington Post:\n\nHundreds of Chinese factory workers angry about strictly timed bathroom breaks and fines for starting work late held their Japanese and Chinese managers hostage for a day and a half before police broke up the strike.\n\nAbout 1,000 workers at Shanghai Shinmei Electric Company held the 10 Japanese nationals and eight Chinese managers inside the factory in Shanghai starting Friday morning until 11.50 p.m. Saturday, said a statement from the parent company, Shinmei Electric Co., released Monday. It said the managers were released uninjured after 300 police officers were called to the factory.\n\nA security guard at the Shanghai plant said Tuesday that workers had gone on strike to protest the company's issuing of new work rules, including time limits on bathroom breaks and fines for being late.\n\n\"The workers demanded the scrapping of the ridiculously strict requirements stipulating that workers only have two minutes to go to the toilet and workers will be fined 50 yuan ($8) if they are late once and fired if they are late twice,\" said the security guard, surnamed Feng. \"The managers were later freed when police intervened and when they agreed to reconsider the rules.\"\n\nThe plant makes electromagnetic coils and other electronic products. It was closed Tuesday, said a man who answered at the plant but refused to identify himself. He said no workers were on strike and staff would return to work on Wednesday.\n\nStrikes have become commonplace in China, as factories operating in highly competitive markets try to get more productivity from their labor force and workers connected by mobile phones and the Internet become more aware of their rights.\n\nShinmei Electric's statement didn't say specifically what the workers were protesting, but said management reforms and labor policies were believed to be a cause. It said talks were under way with workers at the plant and that police were questioning staff.\n\nA man who refused to give his name from the press office of the Shanghai police bureau said he had no information about the incident and referred calls to the Shanghai government press office, where calls rang unanswered.\n\nFrom the South China Morning Post:\n\nMore than 1,000 furious migrant workers besieged a factory in Shanghai and held 18 Japanese and Chinese managers against their will for more than a day, after the workers were required to abide by unequal regulations.\n\nThe workers of Japanese electronic appliance maker Shanghai Shinmei Electric staged a strike and besieged the factory for two days, starting around 8am on Friday morning, following the introduction of a new factory policy calling for heavy fines, demerits or immediate termination for workers who made a mistake, the Japan-based Asahi Shimbun reported yesterday.\n\nAt least one Chinese manager with hypertension passed out after being forcibly detained along with the 17 others - seven Chinese and 10 Japanese - in two office rooms between Friday and Saturday. The company's president, Hideaki Tamura, was among those held.\n\nOn Saturday night, more than 400 Shanghai police officers freed the managers.\n\nTamura told the Asahi Shimbun by phone that more than 500 workers besieged his office, and the managers were not allowed to use the toilet. Tamura was locked in his office with six other Japanese managers and five Chinese, while the remaining six were locked in another room.\n\nThe report said the factory's new disciplinary policy was part of a reform scheme after the appliance maker was acquired by a Chinese company last year.\n\nAngry workers were cited by the BBC as saying that the new factory regulations, with what they said were 49 unequal clauses, triggered the protest.\n\nAnother assembly worker, who declined to be named, said they were also angry over the acquisition. She said workers feared that they would no longer enjoy the benefits accumulated in their previous years working in the factory after they signed a new contract following the acquisition by a Chinese firm in Dalian, Liaoning province.\n\nShe said that several of her colleagues were injured when the anti-riot police rushed into the factory. One worker allegedly suffered broken ribs and another suffered a head injury.\n\nAnother worker wrote via a microblog about the desperate situation management allegedly put them in.\n\n\"We earn less than 2,000 yuan [HK$2,468] a month, but we could be subjected to fines of 50 to 100 yuan for arriving late or spending more than two minutes in the toilet,\" the post said.\n\nThe company issued a statement yesterday apologising to workers for the new regulations, with a promise that their salaries would be increased.","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-01-18T21:20:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:11:09.237738","geo":{"coords":[121.473704,31.230393],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"China","adminArea3":"Shanghai","formattedAddress":"Shanghai, China","adminArea5":"Shanghai"}},"id":"2A1mxvZzRlWbGyfmLfogkQ","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:45:03.434927"},{"remoteID":"11834","license":"unknown","language":{"code":"en"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"flood"},{"confidence":1,"name":"land-slide"},{"confidence":1,"name":"armed-conflict"},{"confidence":1,"name":"conflict"},{"confidence":1,"name":"death"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Indonesian"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"Indonesia: Floods - Jan 2013","content":"Starting on 16 Jan 2013, heavy trains triggered extensive flooding in the greater Jakarta area.

The woman says she believes she was arrested because of her work nursing wounded rebels. Describing how she was taken from her home by “Assad’s thugs” and transported to the detention center, she says: “They started torturing me while we were still in the armored vehicle.”\n\nOnce at the prison, she was subjected for three days to “shabh,” a hanging torture technique in which the victim’s hands are tied to the ceiling. “They also used electricity against me,” she says. “They lashed me with electric cables. They hit women with electric cables! They gave me electric shocks.”\n\nA 55-year-old woman faced the same torture, and a 16-year-old media activist was raped by her jailers, according to the video. There were 9-year-old children held in the same facility, arrested because they had written on walls, the woman says. \n\nTranslator Syrian identifies itself as “a group of independent young people” with the goal to “distribute and publicize the crimes of Bashar al-Assad against the unarmed Syrian people to the whole world.” \n\nThe date and location of the reported rape is unknown.

The <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=169358525\" target=\"_blank\">AP reports</a> that the locals are building new tombs, police are unable to enforce regulations and secure the site. But worst of all the piece speculates that the new Islamist regime holds little respect for the ancient past. Here's a flavor:<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qDcfWM45lOk/UPcvGpgMWqI/AAAAAAAAxFg/OCO9Ptw2qPo/s1600/853c744e3e8444b281e253826ee6b4e7-eb58a22ab4a99b01260f6a7067009bef.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"201\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qDcfWM45lOk/UPcvGpgMWqI/AAAAAAAAxFg/OCO9Ptw2qPo/s320/853c744e3e8444b281e253826ee6b4e7-eb58a22ab4a99b01260f6a7067009bef.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n<div>\n<i>In the case of Dahshour, villagers say their cemeteries are full and authorities don't give permits or land for new ones. So they took matters into their own hands and grabbed what they insist is empty desert to erect family tombs.\n\n\"The dearest thing for us is burying our dead,\" said Mohammed Abdel-Qader, a resident of nearby Manshiet Dahshour. \"This land here is wide and flat, it's a valley. Where are the antiquities they talk about? ... We have no antiquities here.\"</i></div>\n<div>\n<i>. . .</i></div>\n<div>\n<i>The cemetery expansion is the most dangerous encroachment yet because of how close it comes to the Dahshour monuments, which are on the UNESCO World Heritage site list, Younes said. Moreover, Dahshour is largely unexcavated, since the area was a closed military zone until 1996. What remains buried is believed to be a treasure trove shedding light on the largely unknown early dynasties.\n\n\"When you build something over archaeological site, you change everything. We can't dig in and know what is inside,\" Younes told The Associated Press. \"This is the only virgin site in all of Egypt.\" </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n The story notes that the construction of new tombs, though illegal, may also be cover for looting. The piece paints a troubling picture. Consider the difficult time Egyptian officials must have had in protecting and preserving a site like this. They must weigh the concerns of angry local populations, be wary of the more dangerous antiquities looters, and also work to preserve the site.<div>Questions or Comments?

Al Huswayieh is located near the Al Qusayr district, just south of Homs. Various news sources have reported that government forces killed more than 100 people in Homs on the same day as the massacre in the small town. \n\nThe video shows three women, faces kept entirely covered, seated side-by-side and crying. A man, off camera, introduces the clip, saying that because no journalists were present, the massacre was not reported to the press. “These are the testimonies of some survivors,” he says. \n\nOne woman begins: “We were in our homes. At 7 a.m. they entered town. Their heads were wrapped. They were not in the regular army. They were carrying hatchets and bottles of arak [an alcoholic drink] and they started slaughtering, skinning, killing.”\n\nShe describes how shabiha (plainclothes militia) members shot men and cattle in the fields, burned children, and took whole families away. A woman, nine months pregnant and mother to four, was shot while holding her 11-year-old son, the woman says. \n\nAll money, mobile phones, and jewelry were confiscated, the woman says, but “if a woman did not have money or jewelry they would strip and rape her.” \n\n“Forty-two girls and women were raped in front of us, and from 7 until 8 we were used as human shields,” she says. “This is a massacre and a crime with no precedent.”\n\nWhen the other women spoke they related the same stories, but did not mention the alleged rapes again. The second half of the video contained no audio. \n\nThe exact location of the reported rapes is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-01-16T09:45:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:09:21.025951","geo":{"coords":[36.576469,34.511669],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"Syria","formattedAddress":"Syria"}},"id":"QJ2XI0qQRJmRZUYkiGCzxg","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:24:30.892215"},{"remoteID":"17579-731","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Egypt"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"Correction: Egypt-Encroaching on Antiquities story - The Associated Press","content":"<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"7\"><tr><td width=\"80\" align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"></td><td valign=\"top\"><br /><div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></div><div><a href=\"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&amp;fd=R&amp;usg=AFQjCNF76sYehfC74O8CkbnA5UL5K1TiPg&amp;url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iiee9KXbDcUSuIDO44f5Z6aIzjqg?docId=2ce51daf4b954ec7881200540cbae26d\"><b>Correction: Egypt-Encroaching on <b>Antiquities</b> story</b></a><br /><b>The Associated Press</b><br />The illegal expansion of a local cemetery has alarmed <b>antiquities</b> experts, who warn the construction endangers the ancient, largely unexplored complex of Dahshour, where pharaoh Sneferu experimented with the first true, smooth-sided pyramids that his <b>...</b><br /><br /><a href=\"http://news.google.com/news/more?ncl=dCuXejkCoeHrsOM&amp;ned=us\"><nobr><b></b></nobr></a></div></td></tr></table>","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-01-16T05:42:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:14:20.715949","geo":{"coords":[30.802498,26.820553],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"Egypt","adminArea3":"Al Wadi al Jadid","formattedAddress":"Markaz El Wahat El Kharga, Egypt","adminArea5":"Markaz El Wahat El Kharga"}},"id":"QwWWZx39Tt2yVhqlceRtCg","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:01:26.335572"},{"remoteID":"24609-324","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"CDRD"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Pending"},{"confidence":1,"name":"FAQ"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Mogadishu"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Humanitarian/Cash Relief"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"FAQ/CDRD/Mogadishu/Pending","content":"Translated SMS: We are IDPs of Hawlwadaag and Maslah camps, We would like to request from DRC to help and support us, as we didn't got any aid in last decades from any agency, for that reason we are again requesting DRC's support .

Multiple sources reveal the strike was based on workers’ demands for a raise in wages. Currently, the workers’ monthly base salary is 1,300 RMB ($209 USD). During peak seasons, workers may earn up to 2,600 RMB ($417.8 USD), including overtime, if they work 12 hours a day, 26 days a month. But during off seasons, which last from February to June, workers may only earn the base salary.  After deductions, the workers are earning merely 1,100 RMB ($177 USD) per month. Further, Foxconn provides no communication channels for workers to voice their frustrations. According to strike participants, they carried out this strike to demand higher wages. And if Foxconn refuses to raise wages, then they will not return to the factory from home after Spring Festival this year.\n\nThe strike began in the evening on January 10. Over 200 workers working the night shift carried out the strike. Some day-shift workers joined them the next day. Jian Yi Avenue near the Foxconn factory was blocked by the workers. The government of Fengcheng, Jiangxi sent police officers to the scene.\n\nAccording to CLW source, Foxconn will conduct labor union elections in 2013. CLW appeals to Foxconn to elect a labor union which can actually represent the workers and establish communication and negotiation mechanisms between workers and the company so as to improve workers’ conditions.\n\nFrom WSWS:\n\nFoxconn, the world’s largest outsourcing electronics giant, has been hit by a stoppage in one of its suppliers, following numbers of tense disputes in its plants last year. According a report by Hong Kong-based Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour (SACOM), the latest strike over improved pay and conditions erupted on January 10 at the Jiangxi Xin Hai Yang Precision Components in Fengcheng, Jiangxi Province. The company employs 8,000 workers.\n\nOn the following day, more than 1,000 workers took to the street and blocked a main road near the factory. The authorities responded by sending out a large contingent of riot police to suppress the protest. According to the dissident China Jasmine Revolution Web Site, the police used water cannon and pepper spray to attack workers. Scores were injured and arrested. \nFoxconn, which assembles electronic goods for Apple, Nokia and other global giants, issued a statement dismissing the incident as a “workplace issue”. Seeking to absolve itself of responsibility, Foxconn said it did not own the supplier, but wanted to see “our suppliers address their workplace issues in a responsible manner.”\n\nThese comments are a sham. According to SACOM, the conditions at this supplier plant were typical of those in Foxconn’s own vast sweatshops. “The monthly basic salary of Foxconn workers is 1,300 yuan ($US209). Workers cannot support themselves and their dependents from the basic salary. After deductions for food and dormitory, the disposable income for workers is meagre.\n\n“Apart from the low wages, workers are not respected on the production line. The soldering workers only receive a surgical mask once every two days. Sometimes, if the shop floor runs out of masks, workers only get one new mask per week. In the winter, the temperature in Fengcheng is as low as 3 degrees Celsius. Hot drinking water in the dormitory is limited. Furthermore, there was no access to hot water in the bathroom. As such, workers would only take a shower once a week. Only a few days ago, workers finally had access to hot water in the bathroom.”\n\nConcerned not to embarrass Foxconn or its corporate clients, especially Apple, the state-owned media emphasised that the striking workers had returned to work. However, even the official news agency, Xinhua, had to refer to the appalling conditions in the plant. One worker interviewed said she worked 10 and a half hours a day and earnt just $349 a month. “The dorm conditions are rather poor, with more than 10 people sharing one room,” she added.\n\nFrom Market Watch:\n\nHon Hai Precision Industry Co. said in a statement late Sunday that a \"workplace issue\" took place at a supplier factory in China, following a report Friday that alleged a strike had broken out at one of the company's supplier plants.\n\nHon Hai, also known by its tradename Foxconn, said the issue occurred at the facility of Jiangxi Xin Hai Yang Precision Components Co., located in China's eastern Jiangxi province.\n\nIts statement followed a report Friday by watchdog group China Labor Watch, which said a strike broke out at the plant, with workers calling for higher wages.\n\nHon Hai said in its statement that \"this is not a Foxconn company but, in keeping with our desire to see our suppliers address their workplace issues in a responsible manner, we have asked the management of this firm to work with its employees and local government representatives to resolve their concerns and ensure that they meet the high standards of workplace and living conditions that we expect from any firm associated with our company.\"\n\nIn recent months, Foxconn has faced a spate of labor problems. Last week it announced it was carrying out an investigation with Chinese law enforcement officials over allegations that Foxconn employees were involved in illegal payments from supply chain partners. Meanwhile late last year the company confirmed it had used child labor at one Chinese factory, and a large-scale riot broke out.\n\nFrom Chinabidding.com:\n\n富士康每年总有那么就此劳工纠纷，这在业内已经是公开的秘密。在连续的跳楼事件之后，又相继发生了太原暴乱、学生工等事件。转眼间，距离2010年富士康“连环跳”事件已经过去近两年了。在此期间，社会公众从未停止对富士康管理模式的讨论和对100余万富士康员工处境的关注。面对社会舆论的压力，富士康也采取了包括加薪、内迁、成立员工关爱中心等一系列措施，以图改善企业形象。但是目前富士康又被爆出发生工人罢工事件。\n\n　　北京时间1月15日消息，据国外媒体报道，富士康表示，该公司在中国的一家供应链厂商发生了“劳资问题”。此前曾有报道称，该工厂工人因薪酬问题举行了罢工。\n\n　　上周日，富士康发表声明称，此次发生罢工事件的工厂位于中国江西省丰城市，名为江西新海洋精密组件有限公司(Jiangxi Xin Hai Yang Precision Components Co.)。富士康在声明中表示，“我们已要求该厂的管理层与员工及当地政府代表一同协作，以解决员工们的担忧，并确保该厂能够达到公司希望关联企业所具备的工作及生活环境标准。”\n\n　　富士康拒绝披露更多信息，其发言人拒绝置评。\n\n　　上周四，有媒体报导称，因对低薪酬及恶劣环境不满，富士康有两家供应链厂发生罢工事件，且罢工一直持续到周五。中国劳工观察(China Labor Watch)组织表示，200名夜班工人于周四晚间开始举行罢工，直到周五，更多的白班工人也加入了罢工的行列。据悉，员工们要求提高薪酬待遇，否则春节过后将不会返厂继续工作。\n\n　　此前，中国电子设备生产行业已发生过数次工人骚乱时间。人工成本上涨，及员工不断提高的薪酬预期，不仅对富士康等大型生产商造成影响，同时也波及到了供应链上的小型企业。分析师表示，工人罢工次数不断增加可部分归咎于时代更替、工人受教育程度较高，年轻工人喜欢上网，懂得捍卫自己的权利等原因。\n\n　　去年9月，富士康位于中国北部的一家工厂发生骚乱，数千名防暴警察出动，致使40人受伤。10月，台湾仁宝电子(Compal Electronics Inc.)成都工厂的2000名员工举行罢工，致使该厂生产暂时停止。\n\n　　《中国劳工通讯》(China Labour Bulletin)表示，2012年前8个月，平均每月发生29次罢工及抗议事件，超出2011年同期的每月11起。\n\n　　当富士康的劳工问题摆在我们面前时，这不再仅是富士康的内部问题，这也是中国制造业的现状，低报酬、环境恶劣、员工得不到最基础的关爱，这些对于血汗工厂体制的拷问将越来越迫切，更具人性与尊严，使社会经济发展模式的探索更有力量。","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-01-10T21:27:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:11:10.672502","geo":{"coords":[115.771094,28.159142],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"China","adminArea3":"Jiangxi","formattedAddress":"Jiangxi"}},"id":"94Z90eLXRmeCpb9ak4rvlQ","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:44:56.641744"},{"remoteID":"34416-289","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Miscarriage of justice/unfair treatment"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"Saudi executes convicted Lankan maid Rizana Nafeek","content":"The Government of Sri Lanka expressed shock and grief over the beheading of a maid Rizana Nafeek for killing an infant in Saudi Arabia.

Women’s eNews first posted Bneyan’s narrative, which was translated with her permission from a Facebook post, on February 6, and the Daily Beast’s Women in the World wrote about her ordeal on March 10. According to Women's eNews, Bneyan was released from detention on January 9.\n\nBneyan, who identified herself to the Daily Beast as a nonviolent protester, said she was imprisoned after she stood holding a sign that read “Only in Syria: the thinking mind is imprisoned.” The date of her arrest is not specified, but she was reportedly freed on January 9 as part of a mass prisoner exchange “involving several thousand Syrians and 48 Iranian hostages.” \n\n“Twenty-two days after getting out of prison, or living hell,” she wrote on February 3. “Twenty-two days, I’ve been close to total hysteria from what happened.” She wrote that people keep telling her that these feelings will pass and that in a few days’ time she will be able to forget. But, “it hasn’t passed,” she wrote, “and I haven’t forgotten what has happened, and what is happening in there now, still, right this very minute.” \n\nAt 2 a.m. one morning, a 25-year-old fellow detainee identified by Bneyan as Um Tim, was ordered by the deputy to his office, she said. \n\n“You could tell that something had happened to her,” Bneyan told the Daily Beast, because the young woman came back from questioning wearing different clothing and subsequently broke protocol by spending the next few hours in the bathroom. Over the course of these hours, Um Tim described her ordeal to Bneyan. She was allegedly raped twice by a Syrian Army military captain, who targeted her with “special, provocative treatment” because she was known to be married to a man working for the Free Syrian Army. Bneyan stated that the regime was seeking FSA locations, positions, brigade names, and plans from her. \n\nThe captain forced her onto a bed, tying her arms and legs to keep her down, Bneyan said. “When he started to rape her, she started to scream,” Bneyan said, “He said, ‘no one will help you.’ And then he opened the door, so everyone [other prison guards] could heard. He said, ‘See? No one’s going to help you.’ He then said, ‘you must confess and you must help us. Confess.’ This was after the first time.”\n\nAt this point in her story, Bneyan recalled, Um Tim broke down. “I haven’t forgotten her face, her tears, her ‘oh God, oh God,” Bneyan wrote for Women’s eNews. Bneyan said that after the young woman was raped, she would repeat “no oppression stays forever” over and over to herself in the cell. \n\nHer fellow prisoner’s attack came at a time where Bneyan had been growing “less worried” about the prospect of rape in detention, she said, which she referred to as her “biggest fear.” After almost three weeks in jail without being threatened or seeing any other inmates threatened, the probability of the act seemed diminished. Though she was not raped of sexually violated in any way, Bneyan herself was interrogated for 12 hours and threatened with solitary confinement throughout her imprisonment, she said. She also vividly remembers the ways in which the women around her were continuously tortured and abused: \n\n“I haven’t forgotten the voice of Wala Kayyal, 20 years old,” Bneyan wrote, “when she told me, ‘Look at my back; he beat my back.’ I haven’t forgotten the beat marks and bruises on your back, Wala.” \n\n“I haven’t forgotten how your body spasmed, Alham from al-Muhasan, when you went into your first epileptic fit, or how the warden spewed curses at you, ‘You’re faking, get up, you nothing.”\n\n“I haven’t forgotten the face of Mona al-Wadi when they told her she would be executed the following day at 10 a.m.”\n \nShe ends her first-person narrative with a promise: “I will not forget these women. They are in a living death behind bars. Be with them, God.” \n\nThe date and location of the reported rape is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-01-09T12:55:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:09:20.367945","geo":{"coords":[38.996815,34.802075],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"Syria","formattedAddress":"Syria"}},"id":"dN0kcnReR8yllEge6bKsLA","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:24:29.762827"},{"remoteID":"17579-688","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Trusted Reports"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"The #Archaeology News Network: Gaza's heritage sit...","content":"The #Archaeology News Network: Gaza's heritage sites at risk from war and neglect http://t.co/7qwW1agl #heritage","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-01-09T02:39:30.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:14:25.472883","geo":{"coords":[-160.0019989013672,60.97869873046875],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"United States","streetAddress":"Street","adminArea3":"AK","adminArea4":"Bethel C.A.","adminArea5":"Bethel","postalCode":"99559","formattedAddress":"Street, Bethel, AK 99559"}},"id":"j5IBqDuMRbq80r2rNxd_bQ","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:01:43.844372"},{"remoteID":"17579-689","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Trusted Reports"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"The #Archaeology News Network: Historic Iraqi buil...","content":"The #Archaeology News Network: Historic Iraqi building gets a new lease on life http://t.co/hn3U8rHM #heritage","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-01-09T02:30:33.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:14:24.970721","geo":{"coords":[-160.0019989013672,60.97869873046875],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"United States","streetAddress":"Street","adminArea3":"AK","adminArea4":"Bethel C.A.","adminArea5":"Bethel","postalCode":"99559","formattedAddress":"Street, Bethel, AK 99559"}},"id":"unmB09h2QeWQj4JLSy65cg","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:01:46.250311"},{"remoteID":"12605-124","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Retention - Downspout Re-direct"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Permeability - Healthy Living Soil"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Permeability - Permeable Hardscape"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Retention - Sponge Gardens"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Conservation - Irrigation"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Conservation - Mulch"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Conservation - Plants"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"Mar Vista, CA (Los Angeles) - residence","content":"Owner/landscape architect:\nTom Rau, ASLA\nLandscape Architect\nph: 310.384.7307 | tomrau@verizon.net\nCA license #5681 | http://www.tomrau-rla.com/ \n\nIn early 2011, the homeowners replaced the lawn with a meadow comprised mostly of native plants and grasses.  They were inspired by \"American Meadow\" designs by John Greenlee and wanted to create a natural-looking, water-wise ecosystem that incorporated the three principles of an Ocean Friendly Garden: conservation, permeability and retention. They kept existing mature Camellias and trees and planted a variety of California native and climate appropriate grasses, bulbs, ferns and flowering perennials that thrive in clay soil, provide wildlife habitat and bloom at various times during the year.\n  A swale in the front yard is the main attraction with its colorful Iris, Coral Bells, and Meadow Foam blooms. Wildlife activity has noticeably increased since the meadow installation, not only in terms of birds, lizards, insects, spiders, but also under the surface, as earthworm populations have grown thanks to a heavy layer of mulch that suppresses weeds and feeds the soil biology. Maintenance needs are minimal, involving monthly weeding, quarterly applications of compost tea and semiannual pruning, so we have time to relax and enjoy the garden. No use of chemical fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, blowers, mowers or weed whackers is needed; the garden thrives on its own and provides a healthy and attractive environment.\n  Irrigation consists of both drip irrigation and mini rotators with a \"smart\" controller that schedules watering times based upon real-time weather information. This has resulted in significant water savings compared to the former lawn. Other site features to retain water include a decomposed granite center strip in the driveway, two infiltration pits in the back yard, and rain barrels.","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-01-09T01:47:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:10:49.567643","geo":{"coords":[-118.433918,34.013127],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"United States","streetAddress":"11972 Palms Blvd","adminArea3":"CA","adminArea4":"Los Angeles Co.","adminArea5":"Los Angeles","postalCode":"90066","formattedAddress":"11972 Palms Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90066"}},"id":"Q3_pqqizSE69nX22O6c1qg","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:41:43.592199"},{"remoteID":"3691-374","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"česky, čeština","code":"cs","name":"Czech"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Praha ekologická"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"Prokopské údolí : Nízkoenergetické domy na úkor přírody","content":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 16px;\">Za souhlasu komunálních politiků se nové bytové domy developera JRD stavějí v ochranném pásmu pražské přírodní rezervace Prokopské údolí.

Jedna z jeho realizací, Vila pod Altánem ve Strašnicích, získala před dvěma lety Cenu České komory architektů v soutěži Český energetický projekt. V současné době je před zahájením větší projekt bytových domů Ecocity Malešice. Tři ambiciózní projekty úsporného bydlení developer projektuje také na opačném konci Prahy, na hraně Prokopského údolí, kde vlastní lukrativní pozemky. Osm luxusních vil Diamantica se již začíná stavět.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify;\">Tento „exkluzivní šperk na pražském realitním trhu“, slibující „unikátní bydlení pro výjimečné lidi“, jak investor vily popisuje, je však pro místní občany noční můrou. V jednom má totiž developer pravdu: v Praze je jen velmi málo míst, která by se svým přírodním kouzlem mohla rovnat Prokopskému údolí. Jak vily Diamantica, tak další plánované projekty (dva bytové domy Semmering a bytový komplex Trilobit) jsou přitom ukázkovým příkladem rozrůstání výstavby na místa, kam nepatří. Například bytové domy Semmering, v blízkosti železničního viaduktu na trati Pražský Semmering, pohltí louku s dětským hřištěm pouhých dvacet metrů od hranice přírodní rezervace, přičemž zákon ukládá dodržovat ochranné pásmo. To je narušeno také u Dalejského potoka, který před ústím do Vltavy vytváří krasový kaňon, kde žijí chráněné druhy rostlin a živočichů. Ke stavební činnosti v ochranném pásmu je potřeba úřední souhlas. Ten ovšem Odbor ochrany prostředí pražského magistrátu vydal v červnu 2010 a vážnější připomínky nevznesl ani Výbor životního prostředí Městské části Prahy 5.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify;\">Vstřícný postoj dotčených úřadů vůči JRD je zarážející už proto, že se tak vytváří precedent pro další podobné plány ukrajující stále více z cenného volného prostoru. Netřeba připomínat, že Prokopské údolí, výjimečné svou biodiverzitou i krajinným rázem a prohlášené za evropsky významnou lokalitu, slouží k relaxaci tisíců Pražanů a zejména obyvatel okolních sídlišť. Pro mnohé z nich představuje jedinou dostupnou zelenou zónu. Politici ani investor navíc nerespektují námitky místních obyvatel, které se týkají zástavby desetiletí nezastavěných pozemků v ochranném pásmu rezervace i zhoršení dopravy na již tak přetížených komunikacích, které zákonitě přijde s novými rezidenty. Jedinou přístupovou silnicí je totiž úzká ulice Hlubočepská, kudy vede také hojně využívaná cyklotrasa A12. Starousedlíci, kteří pravidelně komunikují s radnicí, se shodují v pocitu, že své zájmy hájí nejen proti developerovi, ale také proti úředníkům městské části.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify;\">V místě působí několik více či méně aktivních občanských sdružení: Společnost pro ochranu Prokopského a Dalejského údolí, Dalejský strážce, Prokopovo, Přátelé Prokopského a Dalejského údolí, Hlubočepští a další. Ta dlouhodobě vystupují nejen za ochranu zdejší jedinečné přírody, ale také za zachování rázu starých Hlubočep a místních památek. Jednu z nich, významnou funkcionalistickou stavbu, továrnu Hydroxygen od architekta Františka Alberta Libry z roku 1939, zachránili místní před demolicí v roce 1989, když se jim podařilo prosadit její zapsání na seznam nemovitých kulturních památek. Dnes, citlivě rekonstruovaná Františkem Pajerem a Vladimírem Hronem, slouží podnikatelským účelům firmy Hydroxygen.</span><br style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify;\" /><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify;\">Na znovuoživenou továrnu navazuje další hodnotný industriální objekt bývalé továrny Technoplyn. Ten je v horším stavu, dlouhodobě nevyužívaný, prozatím však staticky nenarušený. Areál továrny z devadesátých let 19. století s množstvím původních architektonických detailů patří mezi nejstarší pražské průmyslové zóny, unikátní je i tím, že jej nenarušily pozdější zásahy. Nachází se tu také další Librova realizace, funkcionalistická trafostanice. Snaha starousedlíků o prohlášení Technoplynu kulturní památkou před pěti lety skončila neúspěšně. A právě s touto lokalitou má JRD velké plány. Továrnu hodlá zbourat a na jejím místě chce postavit bytový komplex Trilobit, čítající asi čtyřicet bytů a sedmdesát parkovacích míst v podzemních garážích. Demoliční výměr již má. Původní návrh ateliéru Podlipný &amp; Sladký Architekti počítal se zachováním některých částí továrního areálu. Aktuální dokumentace ale doznala podstatných změn a z továrny tak nezbude nic, snad kromě komína.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify;\">Tomáš Homola, předseda Komise územního rozvoje Prahy 5, nadstandardní vstřícnost vůči JRD odmítá: „Městská část v žádném případě nestraní investorovi, ale na druhé straně nemůže soukromému vlastníkovi nařizovat, co má na pozemku stavět. Také bych si na území Prokopského údolí raději představoval sportoviště nebo jiné stavby s veřejnou funkcí, ale bohužel město a ani městská část nejsou vlastníkem těchto pozemků.“ Obecnější koncepce rozvoje oblasti Hlubočep dosud neexistuje. „Jakékoli studie, které by si městská část nechala zpracovat, nejsou pro vlastníky nemovitostí závazné a tzv. regulační plány jsou zcela v rukách Hlavního města, a ne městských částí. Bohužel,“ doplňuje Homola. Zdánlivě rezignovaný přístup města, které se zaklíná zákonným postupem investora a nedotknutelností soukromého vlastnictví, však není nezištný. JRD totiž žádá pro projekt Trilobit městskou část o výjimku, protože podle regulí územního plánu překračuje poměr ploch určený pro bytové účely na úkor nebytových. Městská část zase její udělení podmiňuje opravou dávno nevyhovující místní komunikace, kterou chce uhradit po investorovi. Ten to sice odmítá, ale pokud by nakonec k vzájemné dohodě došlo, byla by to s ohledem na charakter a objem povolené výstavby přece jen hodně vysoká cena.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify;\">Chování radnice je nicméně z pohledu občana nesrozumitelné, protože nehájí jeho zájmy. Běžný postup bývá následující: developer svůj projekt nejprve projednává s politiky a úředníky a upravuje tak, aby zúčastněným vyhovoval, a teprve když mají obě strany jasno, přichází na řadu územní řízení za účasti veřejnosti. Takové řízení je pak ale víceméně formalitou a šance projekt pozměnit či mu zabránit se blíží nule. JRD se dušuje: „V žádném případě bychom si nedovolili stavět proti normám a zásadám zachování přírody či bez řádných povolení a bez souladu se zákonem.“ Že však novostavby pro „bydlení nové generace“ nevratně mění krajinný ráz i charakter místa likvidací původní architektury, už nekomentuje.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify;\">Na vizualizacích je bydlení v nízkoenergetických domech bezstarostné a plné „vyšší kvality života“.

Kerala, the southernmost state of India, has the highest population density is known  as one of the most progressive states, high physical quality of life index, but paradoxically it is home to  a number of diseases caused due to  polluted water bodies, inadequate sanitation facilities. \nIncidentally Kerala   is the first state in India to install electronic public toilets.  This patent pending product e-toilet have automated from entry to sewage treatment, and operates on sensor based technology. These technologies make the e-toilets conserve power and water, keep them clean and hygienic all the time and provide the  performance status of the units  on  web based interface. This unique feature of the e-toilets provide more transparency and accountability  towards the  public infrastructure developed by the local Government bodies under the three tier system of Governance, which empower people democracy at the grassroots. The  convergence of electronics, web and mobile technologies make the toilets  a next generation public sanitation infrastructure. \nNow, these e-toilets are connected over a GPRS network and is called as Connected e-toilet  Infrastructure (CeTI).  These network of e-toilets would empower the decision makers of the emerging cities in India to manage and monitor the performance of their public sanitation infrastructure. First CeTI in India is operational in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, with 26 e-toilets connected over a GPRS network. A traveller can access the e-toilet map over a web interface and can view the locations of e-toilets in his itinerary and plan on her halts, ahead of her journey. This is one element of MESH Cities which we envisage to build and would make the lives of its citizens and tourists much more better.","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-01-07T01:39:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:13:12.923883","geo":{"coords":[76.787041,9.264758],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"India","streetAddress":"Pathanamthitta Thzhoorkadavu Road","adminArea3":"Kerala","formattedAddress":"Pathanamthitta Thzhoorkadavu Road, Thazhevettipram, Pathanamthitta, India","adminArea5":"Pathanamthitta","adminArea4":"Pathanamthitta"}},"id":"K--5iK2xQI-BMAPgvijyYw","createdAt":"2014-05-04T04:49:34.515508"},{"remoteID":"24670-149","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Responsive Urban Design"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Cognitive Buildings"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Instrumented Landscapes"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Smart Grid"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Ideas"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Responsive Government"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Anything Else"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"Marbles - Studio Roosegaarde","content":"MARBLES are large glowing shapes which interact with people via sound, light and color.\n\nEach MARBLE contains LEDs and smart sensors that instinctively respond to human touch, changing their mood from 'bored' to 'excited'.

She said she thinks her neighbors, many of whom are officers, informed on her when they heard her watching Salafist Sheikh Adnan al-Aroor on TV. In January 2013 or a little before that, she was ambushed early in the morning on her way to work on the Jableh-Latakia highway, he said; a Political Security Intelligence car pulled up and arrested her. She said she believes she was taken to Military Intelligence Branch 235 (also known as the Palestine Security Branch) in Damascus. \n\nShe was detained for four months and was moved through several branches including State Security, Military Security, and Adra Prison (all in Damascus), she said. She stated that when she was moved from branch to branch she would be tortured for the first two weeks each time and then left alone. During her first three months in detention, Abir told Al-Jeblawi, she was hung by her wrists with her toes barely touching the floor, a stress position known as shabeh. While suspended, Abir endured insults, beatings with sticks, and electrocution. \n \nWhile detained, Abir stated that she endured groping and harassment but that she was not raped, though attempts were made—she said her screaming and physical resistance kept her attackers from actually raping her.\n \nAbir told Al-Jeblawi that she heard about the rape of others during her detention. She said she believes that more than 25 women and girls from all over the country were being held in the Palestine Branch when she was there. All were tortured, she said; some were sexually violated and some were raped, “especially if they were good looking.” According to Abir, rape would not occur in the cell; rather, the girl would come back from an interrogation room crying and would describe the rape. In some instances, the perpetrator would say, “Let’s see what you’re going to do with yourself now,” women told her. \n\nBecause Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-01-01T20:26:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:09:20.470191","geo":{"coords":[36.3064,33.5111],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"Syria","formattedAddress":"Damascus, Syria","adminArea5":"Damascus"}},"id":"T8CRdLlWT_CSyqgPU3jhLQ","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:24:33.145194"},{"remoteID":"34369-245","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"3GF.

When the third started, I totally collapsed. I was bleeding all the time. As the last one finished, I fell on the ground. Ten minutes later, the prison doctor came in and took me to the bathroom where he gave me an injection to enable me to stand before the judge.”\n\nThe other rape, Aida told the organization, was perpetrated by two security personnel at the military security branch in Damascus known as the Palestine Branch. After this attack, she was hospitalized:\n\n“On the fifth day, two members of the security unit came and raped me. I had never seen them in the first four days. When they approached me, I told them that I am not a virgin thinking that they will let go away. .... These two members took turn in raping me and after they finished I fainted and fell on the ground. Then, they moved me to a military police hospital in Damascus and contacted my family to tell them that I was dead.” \n\nThe exact dates of the reported assaults are unknown.

She was allegedly attacked on the second floor of a quiet university building by a security guard at the Idlib University campus; the guard was said to be part of a school security staff provided by the Syrian army.\n\nA gynecological exam performed by an ob-gyn confirmed that the student activist was 40 days pregnant, too late for a legal early-stage termination, according to the administrator.
