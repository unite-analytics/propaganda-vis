Edinilen bilgiye göre, Ömer (8) ve İsmail S. (6) kardeşler, geçimini hurdacılıktan sağladığı öğrenilen babaları Yahya S. İle birlikte plastik hurdalarının toplandığı depoya gitti. Baba hurdalıkta çalıştığı sırada çocukları bahçede oyun oynamaya başladı. Bu sırada Ömer, 3 metre derinliğindeki pis su dolu çukuru fark edemeyerek içine düştü. Ağabeyinin çukura düştüğünü gören İsmail, beline kadar çukura girerek ağabeyini kurtarmaya çalıştı. Oğlunun bağırarak yardım istemesi üzerine çukurun yanına giden baba, telefonla itfaiye ve polisten yardım istedi. Kısa sürede hurdalığa ulaşan itfaiye erlerinden birisi beline ip bağlayarak suya girdi. İtfaiye eri çocuğu çukurda bulamayınca polis memuru Alper Arıcan (37), montunu ve silahını belinden çıkararak çukura girdi. Polis memuru Arıcan, ilk hamlesinde suya dalarak çocuğu çukurdan çıkarmayı başardı. Çukurdan çıkarılan çocuk, ambulansla kaldırıldığı Karaman Devlet Hastanesi'nde doktorların tüm çabalarına rağmen kurtarılamadı. Olaydan etkilenen kardeşi İsmail S. de Karaman Doğum ve Çocuk Hastalıkları Hastanesi'ne kaldırıldı. \nPolis, olayla ilgili soruşturma başlattı.",

        "content": "On January 20, the online Syrian Observer reported the arrest and rape of a woman named Suad, 35. The story was attributed to the General Commission of the Syrian Revolution, a network of opposition groups.\n\nThe news source described how she had left her home in Marrat al-Numan, on the outskirts of Idlib, to check on her family in Karm al-Zaitoun. On arriving, however, she said that she found that her family had already left the house. Suad and her child were arrested on the way back to her town, at the Wadi ad-Dahab checkpoint, according to the report. She was charged with “being from a neighborhood which had rebelled against the regime” and spent five days at the checkpoint.\n\n“They led me into a horrible room, then suddenly, a group of soldiers attacked me and began to bite me,” Suad said. “At the door, a man named Abu Naif stood. I later learned that he was the commander of the checkpoint. He supervised the torture and gave orders. His role in the tragedy was to put a knife to mine and my son’s throat, and threatened to kill us after the torture ended.”\n\nShe continued: “On the third day, the level of the cruelty doubled and the soldiers began to bite me more violently. Then they injected me with something that made me lose consciousness. But I was woken later by violent punches to the face and verbal, sectarian abuse against me and my child.”\n \nThe soldiers took turns raping her, she said. \n\n“They were filming everything with a camera, leaving me afterwards feeling half dead, amid the screams of my child,” she said. “They released me after five days, and I walked for hours until I reached a Free Syrian Army checkpoint. They took me to my husband’s house in Marrat al-Numan.”\n\nAt the end of the report, Suad was quoted as urging women who have been raped in Syria to speak out: “This will not hurt their dignity, rather it will guarantee their rights, and will make sure that the criminals will be punished,” she said.\n\nThe dates of the reported rapes are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC's Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

(16), 25 Ocak 2012'de jandarmayı arayarak, \"Ben 14 yaşındayım. Ailem beni 5 bin liraya tanımadığım birine sattı, beni zorla evlendiriyorlar yetişin\" diyerek yardım istedi. Bu ihbar telefonu üzerine küçük kızın verdiği adrese baskın yapıldı. Evde düğün hazırlıkları yapılırken A.S.'nin Şakirpaşa Mahallesi'nde kuaföre götürüldüğü öğrenildi. Kuaföre gidilerek A.S. kurtarıldı. Annesi 27 yaşındaki D.S. ile küçük kızın annesinin dini nikahlı eşi 34 yaşındaki Gürbüz U. hakkında, Adana 1'inci Ağır Ceza Mahkemesi'nde 'insan ticareti yapmak' suçundan dava açıldı. Yaklaşık 2 yıl süren dava karara bağlandı. Tutuklanıp daha sonra tahliye edilen baba Gürbüz U., kızının suçlamalarını kabul etmedi. Gürbüz U., \"Kızımı para karşılığı herhangi bir kimseye verme konusunda anlaşma yapmadım. Ben zaten kızımın yanında değildim. Eşim bana telefon açıp, 'kızımı istiyorlar gel' dedi. Bunun üzerine gittim. Kızıma sordum. İstemeyince vazgeçtim. Kızımı tehditle, zorla para karşılığı vermeye çalışmadım\" dedi.\n\n12 yıl hapsi istenen anne D.S. ise kızına, Gaziantep'teki akrabaları Muhammet K. ile söz kestiklerini belirterek, \"25 Ocak 2012'de de nişanı olacaktı. Kızımı nişandan sonra yaşının dolması için 2 yıl bekletecektik. Ancak, kızım istemeyince bozuldu. Başlık parası da almadık. Kızımın gerçek yaşı 17'dir. Kemik testi yaptırılırsa ortaya çıkacaktır\" diye konuştu.\n\nDüğünün yapılacağı gün jandarmayı arayarak satılmaktan kurtarılan A.S. ise, mahkemede ifade değiştirdi. Jandarmadaki ifadesinde kendisini 5 bin liraya sattığı iddia edilen anne ve babasından şikayetçi olup, \"Babam Gürbüz beni tanımadığım bir şahsa 5 bin liraya evlenmem için verdi. 25 Ocak'ta düğünüm yapılacaktı. Erkek tarafı beni almaya gelecekti. Ben defalarca karşı gelmeme rağmen babam beni tehdit ederek zorla vermeye çalıştı. Bileklerimi keserek intihara kalkıştım. Sabah kuaföre gitmek için dışarı çıktım, dönersem beni evlendireceklerdi. Ben de satılmaktan kurtulmak için jandarmaya telefon açtım\" diyen A.S., anne ve babasına iftira attığını söyledi.\nMuhammet K. ile birbirlerini sevdiklerini belirten A.S., \"Aramızda söz yaptık. Söz sırasında Muhammet bana 'seni istemiyorum' dediğinden şuurumu kaybettim. Bu yüzden iftirada bulundum. Böyle bir şey olmadı. Yaşım 18'dir kimlikte 16 gözüküyor\" dedi.\n\nMahkeme heyeti, küçük kızın bu ifadesi üzerine anne D.S. ve baba Gürbuz U.'nun ‘insan ticareti yapmaya' teşebbüs suçunun unsurları bulunmadığı gerekçesiyle beraatına karar verdi.\nİHA",

(13) ile arkadaşı H.Ş. (13) hakkındaki soruşturma tamamlandı. Tutuksuz sanık iki çocuk hakkında, ‘Gece vakti silahla ve birden fazla kişi ile birlikte yağma ve konut dokunulmazlığını ihlal etme’ suçlarından 18'er yıla kadar hapis istendi. \n\n13 Ekim 2013'de, merkez Yüreğir ilçesi Anadolu Mahallesi'nde meydana gelen olayda, S.T., belinden çıkardığı tabancayla bahçede oturan E.K.yi tehdit ederken, H.Ş. bahçedeki bakır kazanı alıp, birlikte kaçtı. E.K.nin ailesinin şikayeti ile iki çocuk gözaltına alındı; fakat söz konusu kazan bulunmadı. Tutuksuz yargılanmak üzere serbest bırakılan S.T. ile H.Ş. hakkında Adana 9. Ağır Ceza Mahkemesi’nde dava açıldı. Cumhuriyet savcısı iddianamede, “Şüphelilerden S.T.nin belinden muhtemelen oyuncak tabancayı çıkartarak ‘susun kıpırdamayın’ diyerek tehdit ettiği, diğer zanlı H.Ş.nin bahçedeki 15-16 kilo ağırlığındaki 450-500 TL değerindeki büyük bakır kazanı alıp kaçtığı anlaşılmıştır.” dedi.\n\nÖnümüzdeki günlerde hakim karşısına çıkacak S.T. ve H.Ş. ise suçlamaları kabul etmedi. Zanlılardan S.T., savcılıkta tabancayı çekerek sağa sola salladım. Çocuklar beni kovaladı, eve kaçtım. Sonra da hakkımızda böyle bir iddiada bulunmuşlar. Amacım çocuklara şaka yapmaktı.\" diye konuştu. \n\nÇocuklardan H.Ş. ise E.K. ile S.T.nin arkadaşı olduğunu belirterek, S.T.nin bakkaldan 1 liraya satın aldığı oyuncak tabancayla şaka yaptığını söyledi. Bu esnada orta boylu, esmer tenli, zayıf yapılı, 16- 17 yaşlarında bir kişi bahçedeki kazanı alarak kaçtığını savunan H.Ş. peşinden koştuğu bu kişiyi yakalayamadığını ileri sürdü. H.Ş, bir süre sonra korkup geri döndüklerini; ardından da evlerine gittiklerini kaydetti.",

Kısa süreliğine baş başa kalmaları için mutfağa gittim. \nDöndüğümde kızım giyiniyor, onlar ise çıplaktı. Ne yaptıklarını bilmiyorum. Sadece ellediklerini düşündüm. Yol parası olarak da 5 TL verdi.\"\n\"PERİŞANIM\"\n\n\nKüçük kızın annesi K.H. ile 3 yıldan bu yana ilişkisi olduğunu kabul eden M.A.İ., zina suçunu işlediğini ancak, kesinlikle F.H. ile ilişkiye girmediğini anlatırken şöyle konuştu: \"Hoş geldin’ deyip yanak yanağa öpüşmüşüzdür. Ben suçlu değilim. Bu olaydan sonra yuvam yıkıldı. Ailem dağıldı.Perişan durumdayım. Para karşılığı ilişkiye girdiğimi baştan beri söyledim.\"\n\nSanıklardan M.T. de anne ile kızının ifadeleri arasında çelişki bulunduğunu ileri sürerek, \"Benim kızla normal yoldan cinsel birlikteliğim olmadı. Anal yoldan birlikte olduk. Kaç kez olduğunu hatırlamıyorum. Her defasında annesi de bizimle oluyordu. Annesine de çocuğuna para veriyordum. Ancak kızının yaşının küçük olduğunu bilmiyordum. Pişmanım\" dedi.\n\nYAŞADIKLARINI ANLATTI\n\nOlaydan dolayı ruh sağlığı bozulduğu ifade edilen F.H. istismarı şöyle anlattı: \"Annem ilk önce beni sanıklardan M.T. ile tanıştırdı. O zamanlar ilköğretim 6’ncı sınıfta okuyordum. M.T. bana kendi evinde ve işyerinin arkasındaki bölümde birçok kez istismarda bulundu. Yine aynı yıllarda annemin tanıştırdığı sanık M.A.İ. de cinsel istismarda bulundu. Annem sadece bu 2 sanıkla görüştürdü. Başkalarıyla görüştürmedi.\"\n\n\"ÇOCUĞUN BABASI BELLİ DEĞİL\"\n\nHalen devlet korumasında bulunan F.H.’nin dünyaya getirdiği kız bebekle erkek sanıklardan alınan DNA örnekleri karşılaştırıldı. Adli Tıp Kurumu’nda yapılan testte bebeğin sanıklardan olmadığı ortaya çıktı.\n\nMahkeme heyeti, sanıklardan K.H.’yi önce, 15 yaşından küçük çocuğu fuhuşa teşvik ekmekten 10 yıl hapis cezasına çarptırdı. Sonra da kendi çocuğunu fuhuşa teşvik ettiği için cezasında yarı oranında artırım yapılarak 15 yıla çıkarıldı. Diğer sanıklar M.T. ile M.A.İ.’ye de, 15 yaşından küçük çocuğa karşı nitelikli cinsel istismar suçundan 10’ar yıl hapis cezası verildi. Sonra da, cezaları suçu birden fazla işledikleri için 15’er yıla, kız çocuğunun ruh sağlığı bozulduğu için de 18’er yıla çıkarıldı. Ayrıca, sanıkların tutukluluklarının devamına karar verildi",

        "content": "Built in 1924 by the Lebanese architect Youssef Afandi Aftimos and then raised by two further floors by the architect Fouad Kozah in 1932, the neo-ottoman style building known as the \"Yellow House\" or the \"Barakat Building\" stands on the crossroad of Damascus street and Independence street. The name of the Yellow House comes from the ocher-coloured sandstone used for its construction.\n\nLocated on the former \"green line\", the Yellow House was a forward control post and sniper base during the civil war. In addition to its strategic location, the airy architecture of the Yellow House, with its transparency and varied shooting angles, was used for military purposes to control the surrounding area, known as the \"Sodeco Crossroads\".\n\nSince the end of the war, the Yellow House, already badly damaged by the conflict, has continued to deteriorate from ageing and acts of vandalism. Threatened with demolition at the end of the 1990s, the Yellow House was finally saved thanks to the efforts of civil society and the commitment of the City of Beirut which led to an expropriation procedure granted on grounds of public interest in 2003.\n\nUnder the terms of the expropriation decree, the Yellow House will be restored to accommodate:\n- a museum,\n- a cultural and artistic meeting place,\n- a facility for archiving research and studies on the city of Beirut throughout history,\n- an urban planning office for the City of Beirut,\n- an underground car-park.\n\nThe decree also provides for the construction of a new building on the free part of the land.\n\nThe project was initiated in 2008 following a cooperation agreement between the City of Beirut and the City of Paris.\n\nText Source: http://www.beitbeirut.org/ \n\n\n*****\n\nEdifié en 1924 par l'architecte libanais Youssef Afandi Aftimos, puis surélevé en 1932 de deux étages supplémentaires par l'architecte Fouad Kozah, l'immeuble dit la « Maison Jaune » ou « Immeuble Barakat » marque de son style néo-ottoman l'angle des rues de Damas et de l'Indépendance. La Maison Jaune doit son appellation au grès ocre employé pour sa construction.\n\nSituée sur l'ancienne ligne de démarcation, la Maison Jaune a été un poste de contrôle avancé et un repaire de francs-tireurs pendant la guerre civile. Outre sa situation stratégique, l'architecture aérienne de la Maison Jaune, faite de transparences et de multiples angles de tirs, a été utilisée à des fins guerrières pour contrôler ce lieu, connu sous le nom de « carrefour Sodeco ».\n\nDepuis la fin de la guerre, la Maison Jaune, meurtrie par le conflit, continue de se dégrader à cause de l'usure du temps et d'actes de malveillance. Menacée de démolition à la fin des années 1990, la Maison Jaune a finalement été sauvée grâce à la mobilisation de la société civile et à l'engagement de la Ville de Beyrouth, à travers une procédure d'expropriation au nom de l'intérêt public, prononcée en 2003.\n\nSelon les termes du décret d'expropriation, la Maison Jaune sera réhabilitée pour abriter :\n- un musée,\n- un lieu de rencontre culturel et artistique,\n- un lieu de conservation des recherches et études portant sur la ville de Beyrouth à travers l'histoire,\n- un Bureau d'urbanisme de la Ville de Beyrouth,\n- des parkings en sous-sol.\n\nLe décret prévoit aussi la construction d'un immeuble neuf sur l'emprise libre du terrain.\n\nLe projet a démarré en 2008 dans le cadre d'un partenariat entre la Ville de Beyrouth et la Ville de Paris. \n\nSource du texte: http://www.beitbeirut.org/",

In fact, the statue was bronze, so the man thought it had ‘only… archaeological value’. However, it had market value too – of at least $20m\n\nHamas heard about the find, arrested the fisherman and confiscated the statue; but because Apollo is iconic and nude, he is un-Islamic and immodest, and therefore undisplayable.

The shabiha member said he raped at least three women and that he “was forced to take part in rapes and killings.”\n\nA local Free Syrian Army officer and the commander of a local division of the Suqour Al-Sham Brigade interrogated the man, who said his name was Mustafa.\n\nFrom a Palestinian refugee community near Hama, Mustafa told the FSA members that he and other shabiha members raped the wife of a man who refused to give them free fuel, according to the report. They did it as an “intimidation tactic,” he said. The story states that the correspondent “could not ascertain whether this was a confession made only under pressure after capture.”\n\nMustafa also said he’d raped a pharmacist in Hama who “refused to sell sedatives used by the militia after she found out it was a false prescription.”\n\nHe went on to tell the FSA members that he had been forced to rape his brother's wife to “get her to persuade her husband to join the irregular militia “and that he threatened to tell her husband about the rape if he didn’t join. He did join, Mustafa said. The Inter-Press reporter asked Mustafa what would have happened if his brother discovered his wife had been raped. He “brushed off the question, seemingly annoyed by it,” according to the story. “The ‘intelligence officer’ said her husband would have killed her, it would have been a question of family honor.”\n\nThe detainee told the FSA that he was “not responsible for his actions because he had been under the influence of drugs given to the fighters of the irregular militia without their knowledge.”\n\nThe dates and exact locations of the reported assaults are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

I was taken to a security branch, blindfolded, and when I entered the branch I was led along with many women to be 'inspected.' I was shocked when I found out that ‘inspection’ consisted of stripping us completely then making us squat in full view of five soldiers. When my turn came, I was pushed and slapped by a soldier when he kept trying to strip me even after I had taken off my outer coat. He insisted I even take of my undershirt and bra. He complained to his superior about me, and threatened that if I did not strip I would face some kind of other treatment. I gave in and took off all my clothes. They even pulled my hair loose and threw it around, thinking I may have hid something in my hair. They asked us all to squat and then walk in front of them.”\n\nUm Yasin was released 10 days after her arrest, and has not told her husband or anyone else besides Alnabky what happened to her. Whenever she is asked about the treatment she received in prison, she says, “Thank God, I was not subjected to anything that has to do with my honor.”\n\nAlnabky told WMC’s Women Under Siege that Um Yasin suffers from psychological effects including severe anxiety symptoms, and has been reviewed by a mental health specialist because she says she feels fatigued and under great emotional pressure.\n\nAside, Um Yasin told Alnabky the story of a 13-year-old girl who was held in her same cell. One time, Um Yasin said, the girl returned from an interrogation session by falling into the cell unconscious. When she came to, the girl told Um Yasin and her cellmates the following story:\n\n“Three officers sat in front of me after they had forced me to strip completely naked. They told me to walk, turn around, and squat. They would ask me, ‘Are you not ashamed of yourself? Are you not ashamed that you are the niece of [they would say the name of her uncle, who works with Syrian security forces]?’” \n\nThe girl said she replied each time that she was not ashamed. \n\nOne of the officers told another, “Check if she looks like a virgin,” according to the activist.\n\n‘How can I tell, sir?” the man asked. “With my finger?’\n\n“No, with a stick,” he allegedly said.\n\nThe girl stressed that the soldiers did not do anything to her along these lines, and Um Yasin told the activist that she is unsure whether the girl was subjected to sexualized violence beyond threats.\n\nThe exact dates of the reported attacks are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC's Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

        "content": "A July 29 Vanity Fair story reported what happened to a 25-year-old woman called “Nada” (not her real name), a member of a Syrian youth organization from Aleppo, who said she was held for eight months by the government for putting up revolutionary posters. She shared her story from a safe house in Turkey near the Syrian border. Originally arrested in Aleppo, Nada said she was held at various prisons and detention centers, including “one of the most renowned torture centers in Damascus.”\n\nNada’s incarceration involved significant abuse, including beatings, threats, and psychological torture, in addition to sexual assault, she said. While in custody, she said, she was partially stripped, blindfolded, and tied to a chair where she was passed  “from man to man” and threatened with sexualized violence. She endured severe beatings including a blow to the face so forceful that “her orthodontia broke through her skin.” \n\n“Talk or we will strip you,” she said her interrogators threatened. \n\nNada did not use the word “rape,” the article says, but an NGO worker told the author that “she had been subject to sexual abuse and had ‘probably been raped’ while there. ‘But she needs to rebuild her life, and you know what rape means in Syrian society.’\n\n“It means no one will marry her,” the NGO worker said. “So she cannot say it.”\n\nDuring one episode, Nada said, she was taken to a cell full of male prisoners dressed in their underwear where she was told that she would be left alone so that the male prisoners might  “take care of me.”\n\n“I thought I was being given to these men for them to rape me.” She then shared, “I think I screamed for three hours. They wanted to break me. Finally, I said, ‘OK, I will tell you the truth.’”\n\nNada described being forced to watch a male prisoner being sodomized; recalling this memory led her to shake and vomit, according to the story.\n\nThe dates and exact locations of the reported sexualized violence are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

When their tanks rolled back into the Alawite neighborhood, the women disappeared with them.”\n\nShe did not state when this occurred but told the paper she left Homs more than a year ago. \n\nAnother report on our map (from the Toronto Star) also talks about women being used as human shields and raped in front of tanks in Homs in March: https://womenundersiegesyria.crowdmap.com/reports/view/182. And this YouTube video mentions that women were allegedly used as human shields in Al Huswayieh, south of Homs, in January: https://womenundersiegesyria.crowdmap.com/reports/view/151.\n\nUm Firas told The Hindu that she is concerned for her teenage daughter, who spent time in the sun in Syria to darken her skin make herself less desirable in order to prevent rape. “She told me, ‘If I turn black, the shabiha [pro-government militia] might not want to rape me,” she said. “They were targeting women.

Both they and their husbands, who were FSA soldiers, had been arrested by two shabiha and were put on a bus for transport to a detention facility. En route, the two men beat and restrained the husbands while they attacked their wives, one of whom was pregnant, the activist said.\n\nThe women were forced to perform oral sex, their cellmate told the activist, and the shabiha raped the woman who was not pregnant. They “raped the breasts” of the pregnant woman, according to the activist, and ejaculated on her. \n\nAfter the sexual assault, the women and their husbands were taken to an unidentified house and held for a brief period before being moved to the Military Intelligence branch, the activist said. \n \nThe date of the reported attack is unknown.

I was shot and taken to a private hospital for treatment but security forces moved me to the Mezzeh Military Hospital in Damascus. I had a lower limb fracture and an injury to the nerves causing paralysis of that limb.\n\n“I was moved to the prisoners holding area in the hospital, which has 14 beds, each has 4 prisoners, all chained, blindfolded, and naked. I stayed there six months. Every day at 3 a.m. a few wounded got executed and new ones admitted. Total executions during my stay reached 1,700 in my holding area, which was #215 and controlled by the security personnel of Palestine Security Branch.\n\n“There was a First Class Private whose name was Khaldoun, but he called himself Azrael, the name of the angel of death. He would beat the patients to death. I witnessed and suffered from different methods of torture, beating with a metal tube, suffocation with military boot or belt, IV shots that kills, burning of the beard, cigarettes burns in the ear and nose, repeated whipping until the patient passed out, kept naked in wintertime with the windows open, and torturers would step on our wounds or burns with their military boots. There were no toilets and we had to urinate and defecate on the beds. Sometimes we were forced to eat our excretions.”\n\nBecause Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

Witnessing will make you wish you had died before you witnessed.” Here is a translation of the narrative overlaying the video:\n\n“The regime forces arrested, raped, and tortured a young woman. They took her child and left her almost naked on the Mid-Circulatory Road in Jobar, Damascus, a frontline area of fighting with the opposition, after they shot at her feet to cripple her so she cannot walk. They wanted to use her as a trap for the FSA fighters who tried relentlessly to save her life. \n\n“As they were beating her child, the young woman was moving in response to his cries, unable to do anything else.\n\n“The FSA wanted to save her, but the regime snipers were shooting during the attempts. Four volunteers went under the snipers and were killed without succeeding.\n\n“The young woman died after 10 hours of physical and psychological agony on the ‘road of death.’\n\n“Hisham Al-Kurdi was the last hero who was martyred attempting to save her. He was from the Alsalhia Freedom Fighters battalion.\n\n“This is the facts of what takes place in Syria every day, and the world continues in its deadly silence!”\n \nThe date the reported rape is unknown.

        "content": "Omar Al-Jeblawi, media spokesman for the Revolutionaries of Jableh, told WMC’s Women Under Siege that shabiha (plainclothes militia) members raped his cousin, who is 27 or 28 years old.\n\nA week before the May 3 massacre in Banyias, Al-Jeblawi’s cousin was heading to Tartous when she was stopped at the first checkpoint near Baniyas. Men in civilian clothes took her to a cabin next to the checkpoint and raped her for about an hour while the others held her down.  They ripped her clothes and threw her out onto the highway, where a friend picked her up.\n\nA few days before WMC’s Women Under Siege met with Al-Jeblawi, his cousin sent him a text message that said she was pregnant from the rape and that she had miscarried. Al-Jeblawi’s mother took his cousin to a doctor because she’s been hemorrhaging, he said. When she first began to feel signs of pregnancy before the bleeding began, he said, she started drinking castor oil, hoping to bring on a miscarriage. He speculated that she actually miscarried from the stress of witnessing her four brothers and four cousins killed at Baniyas.\n\n“It’s very difficult,” Al-Jeblawi said. “She’s always sad. She’s always crying. She always feels like she’s lost something.”\n\nAl-Jeblawi showed a photo of his cousin squatting near the dead bodies of her brothers just after they were killed in the massacre. His cousin said she’d hid in nearby fields during the killing but had heard sounds of shooting and rape.\n\nWhen asked if his cousin is able to see a psychologist, Al-Jeblawi said: “There’s no psychologist for her to see. In our condition, once you start seeing more than one doctor, you start hurting more. After the medical doctor, the family will help with psychology. In general there’s a shortage of these doctors. There are good ones in Latakia, but she has a phobia of checkpoints now.”\n\nBecause Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

After being detained and tortured by Syrian authorities last year, he said, he fled from Damascus to Amman, where he now runs two clinics with a team of counselors. Though many of his 200 patients have said their neighbors or friends have experienced sexualized violence, he said, none have admitted to personal experiences of rape. \n\n“We think that the regime, when the arrest women and put them in jail, the rapes happen in jail,” he said. He believes that sexual assaults occur most frequently in areas like Homs that are home to a number of religious sects. There, it is “easy for opposition groups or the regime to demonize the other size.” He said that while there there can be no certainty due to the lack of real documentation, he believes that rape is not “systematic like in Bosnia.” \n\nThe dates and locations of the reported rapes are unknown.

Women are raped, she says, in “all sorts of ways.”\n\n“They raped women in front of their fathers, mothers, sons, daughters. Even the women whose fingernails were not even seen by any man in their lives. The regime’s gangs raped them.”\n\nShe continues, “They kidnapped women from streets, and most of them were college students. They killed these women while raping them. They threw them on the street naked.” In Qudsaya, a town 4 miles (7 kilometers) west of Damascus in the Rif Dimashq governorate, she says that women were dragged through the neighborhood by their tied feet. “They enter houses, rape, and kill,” she says. “They only leave one person alive so this person can tell the other people what had happened to them… . Once, they shot a woman, and while she was dying they raped her.” \n\nBy her account, the rapes and murders are wholesale and unchecked: “They do not let children live, do not let old people live, do not let women live. All are raped and cut.” \n\nNext she describes the various methods of torture inflicted upon detainees, some of which she implies she may have witnessed, referring to “many videos in my cell.” She does not specify whether the crimes allegedly occurred in an official or unofficial detention center, or whether the perpetrators were government forces or shabiha (plainclothes militia) members. \n\nShe recounts how they dragged a man, wearing only his underwear, from his house. When he begged to see his children one last time, they replied, “Yes, you can see your children, but then we have to rape your wife.” As he protested, she says, they “lowered his underwear, and one of them was trying to rape him and the other one was saying, ‘Let’s cut his dick.’” \n\nThe woman describes how jailers give men electric shocks to their penises “so they cannot have children in the future” as well as other types of torture.\n\nThe dates and locations of the reported rapes and sexualized torture is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

        "content": "A video produced by the Syrian Free Press Network summarizes the rapes and killings allegedly committed by a member of what it calls a “terrorist group” in Baba Amr, Homs. A media-sharing platform called Before It’s News, which allows registered users to post current events and commentary, added the video on February 28. The Syrian Free Press Network refers to itself as a collection of freelance reporters “for the truth, for Syria; for evidence of conspiracy against Syria,” A page linked to their website clarifies their stance as staunchly pro-regime.\n\nThe segment of the news clip that addresses the alleged attacks begins approximately eight minutes in, with a statement by the newscaster that “terrorist Hassam Ali Bakkour confessed to taking part in acts of abduction, rape, and slaughter along with a terrorist group in Homs, in addition to joining Al-Qaeda in Iraq.” \n\nThe newscaster notes that the featured confession first aired on “Syrian TV,” meaning the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA). SANA is a privately owned but “semi-official” source known for its loyalty to the regime. Footage of this original clip is shown without sound, and the Syrian Free Press Network’s recap is in English: \n\n“…Bakkour said that he entered Iraq illegally and joined a group of 200 gunmen from Al-Qaeda in Baghdad, where they participated in terrorist operations for nine days before being told that their work was over and they should return to Syria. He said that he was instructed to abduct four young women from Baba Amr, so he went to where they lived along with four other gunmen, abducted them, and took them to a basement near the roundabout in Baba Amr where they blindfolded them and left them there, only to return the next day and rape them and, later, kill them. He said that afterward, they abducted 10 citizens from various areas in Homs and took them to the same basement and slit their throats in a similar manner.”\n\nThe date of the alleged rapes is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

        "summary": "Activists describe sexualized violence and it consequences in Souria Alghad TV segment",
        "content": "A segment on the Egypt-based TV channel Souria Alghad, or Syria Tomorrow, addresses both the circumstances surrounding the many cases of rape and sexualized violence in Syria as well as the stigma faced by victims in need of medical care and psychosocial services. The clip, which was posted to YouTube by a Nora News account on February 9, features interviews by a man named Yassin Ali with Syrian human rights activists and a number of other professionals in the field. The channel, which describes itself as \"independent\" on its Facebook page, says it aims \"to be a free voice for all Syrians of all affiliations, and to be a truthful image for every inch of Syrian territory.\" \n\nSamah Al-Hadi, an activist and journalist, is the first to speak, her face obscured by dim lighting to protect her identity. “Nobody can follow up on this issue,” she says, referring to the difficulties faced by those seeking to document rape. \n\n“I heard about a young girl, 13 or 14 years old, who got raped in Reef Damascus [the countryside]. I tried to reach her, to understand the truth and how it happened. I heard she was with her parents and they were stopped at a roadblock by the regime forces. Something provoked the father and he spoke rudely to them. As revenge, they took the girl out of the car and went out of sight for a while. When they came back she was crying. \n\n“I had difficulty finding the family. When her relatives and acquaintances found out I was a journalist and that I document similar cases, they worked hard to prevent me from meeting her so that I would not shame her. When I was able to reach the mother and introduce myself, she told the father who I was. He immediately kicked me out of the house. He was in a very difficult mental state. He kept telling me, ‘No girl here was raped,’ and then he wept. That is how much emotional stress he was under. He is a wounded father. I respected his wish and left.” \n\nA writer named Nawal Al-Sibai says she faced similar struggles when she reported from the city where the revolution began. “It was handled wrong from the beginning, when children in Daraa were raped. I was the only one who dared, after three months, to write about the mutilation and cutting off of the genitalia of one child.” \n\nMany of the women discussed the pervasiveness of regime-perpetrated sexualized violence in Syria. Al-Sibai says: “The rape of women is like the rape of men: both are crimes.” Both of these crimes have been “taking place in the Ba’ath regimes in Syria and Iraq, in a systematic way, for the last 50 years.” \n\nWhen asked if rapes were occurring during home raids, Al-Hadi says the groups that make up the regime’s forces are not all the same. “Homes are being raided and searched,” she says. “Nobody can predict what other things can happen too.” \n\n“Syria is a big prison,” she says. Some of the government forces “are prepared psychologically, trained and sometimes chosen from a specific sect, to carry out these atrocities. The same thing for slaughtering with knives, executing unarmed civilians, killing little children, or crushing skulls with a machete or an axe.” \n\nShe tells the story of Rasha Alabd, an emergency technician in Duma, who she says was caring for the wounded in a house. Every inhabitant, including Alabd’s family, she says, was killed. She describes seeing Alabd’s head crushed in with what she believes were axes belonging to government forces.\n\nSabah says she also knows of a 50-year-old woman who was groped and patted down when men raided her home. \n\nHuman rights activist Jud Attar relates another story: “A young activist from the Alawite sect was approached by a very close male friend who claimed he wanted to defect. She believed him and accompanied him to a civilian office where he threatened to turn her in if she resisted his sexual advances. He said, ‘Would you rather go to prison where you will be tortured, raped repeatedly and maybe even killed?’” The woman says that in this instance, the “psychological and emotional trauma was huge,\" but does not specify if and how she was sexually assaulted.\n\nThe program stresses that the suffering of the survivors is compounded by the traditional belief system that prizes purity. Abdullah Almoussi, a member of the Syrian Student Association, cites the rarity with which a victim of rape, or her family, will report the incident. In most cases the reason they don’t report is the “dominant culture that dwells on protecting the girls’ and the families’ reputations.” \n\nAl-Sibai argues that victim-shaming is in part caused by a societal conflation of rape and adultery, and that we must distinguish between the two. “Rape is a crime committed by an individual with power, towards a weaker victim who is refusing to submit, in order to break the victim’s will and humiliate her,” she says. “Adultery is a sin between an individual and his Lord and creator.”\n\nShe goes on to say: “Those women did not choose to have this happen. They protected their honor. They are princesses of purity. Real honor is in your actions, according to Messenger Muhammad. There is no honor killing in Islam, and whoever commits that is a criminal himself.” \n\nA Syrian doctor who asked to remain anonymous explains that she is using experiences gained from the Bosnian war, in which an estimated 50,000-60,000 women were raped, to treat survivors of rape. “We help with shelter so the victim can feel human again,” she says, “and we let her speak on her own without pressuring her. She needs to feel secure.” \n\nA voiceover describes how victims of sexualized violence are tormented by the silence within Syrian society and at the international level. \n\nIn her final words, Al-Sibai says: “Honor does not go away if the body is attacked and insulted forcefully. The real honor is the ability of the society to wake up and protect its men and women from such crimes.” \n\nThe remainder of the clip contains part of a video WMC’s Women Under Siege has previously posted to this map. It features a former prisoner of the regime who attests to the rape of a 16-year-old girl being held in the same prison, and ends with a slogan of defiance written across the screen: “The Syrian women will remain the icon of the revolution that gave the father martyrdom, the brother martyrdom and the son martyrdom.” \n\nThe dates and exact locations of the reported acts of sexualized violence are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

The woman says she believes she was arrested because of her work nursing wounded rebels. Describing how she was taken from her home by “Assad’s thugs” and transported to the detention center, she says: “They started torturing me while we were still in the armored vehicle.”\n\nOnce at the prison, she was subjected for three days to “shabh,” a hanging torture technique in which the victim’s hands are tied to the ceiling. “They also used electricity against me,” she says. “They lashed me with electric cables. They hit women with electric cables! They gave me electric shocks.”\n\nA 55-year-old woman faced the same torture, and a 16-year-old media activist was raped by her jailers, according to the video. There were 9-year-old children held in the same facility, arrested because they had written on walls, the woman says. \n\nTranslator Syrian identifies itself as “a group of independent young people” with the goal to “distribute and publicize the crimes of Bashar al-Assad against the unarmed Syrian people to the whole world.” \n\nThe date and location of the reported rape is unknown.

Al Huswayieh is located near the Al Qusayr district, just south of Homs. Various news sources have reported that government forces killed more than 100 people in Homs on the same day as the massacre in the small town. \n\nThe video shows three women, faces kept entirely covered, seated side-by-side and crying. A man, off camera, introduces the clip, saying that because no journalists were present, the massacre was not reported to the press. “These are the testimonies of some survivors,” he says. \n\nOne woman begins: “We were in our homes. At 7 a.m. they entered town. Their heads were wrapped. They were not in the regular army. They were carrying hatchets and bottles of arak [an alcoholic drink] and they started slaughtering, skinning, killing.”\n\nShe describes how shabiha (plainclothes militia) members shot men and cattle in the fields, burned children, and took whole families away. A woman, nine months pregnant and mother to four, was shot while holding her 11-year-old son, the woman says. \n\nAll money, mobile phones, and jewelry were confiscated, the woman says, but “if a woman did not have money or jewelry they would strip and rape her.” \n\n“Forty-two girls and women were raped in front of us, and from 7 until 8 we were used as human shields,” she says. “This is a massacre and a crime with no precedent.”\n\nWhen the other women spoke they related the same stories, but did not mention the alleged rapes again. The second half of the video contained no audio. \n\nThe exact location of the reported rapes is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

        "content": "Khetam Bneyan, a 19-year-old Syrian activist and law student, attested to the rape of one of her prison mates and the torture and brutalization of many more during her weeks-long detainment in a government facility. Women’s eNews first posted Bneyan’s narrative, which was translated with her permission from a Facebook post, on February 6, and the Daily Beast’s Women in the World wrote about her ordeal on March 10. According to Women's eNews, Bneyan was released from detention on January 9.\n\nBneyan, who identified herself to the Daily Beast as a nonviolent protester, said she was imprisoned after she stood holding a sign that read “Only in Syria: the thinking mind is imprisoned.” The date of her arrest is not specified, but she was reportedly freed on January 9 as part of a mass prisoner exchange “involving several thousand Syrians and 48 Iranian hostages.” \n\n“Twenty-two days after getting out of prison, or living hell,” she wrote on February 3. “Twenty-two days, I’ve been close to total hysteria from what happened.” She wrote that people keep telling her that these feelings will pass and that in a few days’ time she will be able to forget. But, “it hasn’t passed,” she wrote, “and I haven’t forgotten what has happened, and what is happening in there now, still, right this very minute.” \n\nAt 2 a.m. one morning, a 25-year-old fellow detainee identified by Bneyan as Um Tim, was ordered by the deputy to his office, she said. \n\n“You could tell that something had happened to her,” Bneyan told the Daily Beast, because the young woman came back from questioning wearing different clothing and subsequently broke protocol by spending the next few hours in the bathroom. Over the course of these hours, Um Tim described her ordeal to Bneyan. She was allegedly raped twice by a Syrian Army military captain, who targeted her with “special, provocative treatment” because she was known to be married to a man working for the Free Syrian Army. Bneyan stated that the regime was seeking FSA locations, positions, brigade names, and plans from her. \n\nThe captain forced her onto a bed, tying her arms and legs to keep her down, Bneyan said. “When he started to rape her, she started to scream,” Bneyan said, “He said, ‘no one will help you.’ And then he opened the door, so everyone [other prison guards] could heard. He said, ‘See? No one’s going to help you.’ He then said, ‘you must confess and you must help us. Confess.’ This was after the first time.”\n\nAt this point in her story, Bneyan recalled, Um Tim broke down. “I haven’t forgotten her face, her tears, her ‘oh God, oh God,” Bneyan wrote for Women’s eNews. Bneyan said that after the young woman was raped, she would repeat “no oppression stays forever” over and over to herself in the cell. \n\nHer fellow prisoner’s attack came at a time where Bneyan had been growing “less worried” about the prospect of rape in detention, she said, which she referred to as her “biggest fear.” After almost three weeks in jail without being threatened or seeing any other inmates threatened, the probability of the act seemed diminished. Though she was not raped of sexually violated in any way, Bneyan herself was interrogated for 12 hours and threatened with solitary confinement throughout her imprisonment, she said. She also vividly remembers the ways in which the women around her were continuously tortured and abused: \n\n“I haven’t forgotten the voice of Wala Kayyal, 20 years old,” Bneyan wrote, “when she told me, ‘Look at my back; he beat my back.’ I haven’t forgotten the beat marks and bruises on your back, Wala.” \n\n“I haven’t forgotten how your body spasmed, Alham from al-Muhasan, when you went into your first epileptic fit, or how the warden spewed curses at you, ‘You’re faking, get up, you nothing.”\n\n“I haven’t forgotten the face of Mona al-Wadi when they told her she would be executed the following day at 10 a.m.”\n \nShe ends her first-person narrative with a promise: “I will not forget these women. They are in a living death behind bars. Be with them, God.” \n\nThe date and location of the reported rape is unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

She said she thinks her neighbors, many of whom are officers, informed on her when they heard her watching Salafist Sheikh Adnan al-Aroor on TV. In January 2013 or a little before that, she was ambushed early in the morning on her way to work on the Jableh-Latakia highway, he said; a Political Security Intelligence car pulled up and arrested her. She said she believes she was taken to Military Intelligence Branch 235 (also known as the Palestine Security Branch) in Damascus. \n\nShe was detained for four months and was moved through several branches including State Security, Military Security, and Adra Prison (all in Damascus), she said. She stated that when she was moved from branch to branch she would be tortured for the first two weeks each time and then left alone. During her first three months in detention, Abir told Al-Jeblawi, she was hung by her wrists with her toes barely touching the floor, a stress position known as shabeh. While suspended, Abir endured insults, beatings with sticks, and electrocution. \n \nWhile detained, Abir stated that she endured groping and harassment but that she was not raped, though attempts were made—she said her screaming and physical resistance kept her attackers from actually raping her.\n \nAbir told Al-Jeblawi that she heard about the rape of others during her detention. She said she believes that more than 25 women and girls from all over the country were being held in the Palestine Branch when she was there. All were tortured, she said; some were sexually violated and some were raped, “especially if they were good looking.” According to Abir, rape would not occur in the cell; rather, the girl would come back from an interrogation room crying and would describe the rape. In some instances, the perpetrator would say, “Let’s see what you’re going to do with yourself now,” women told her. \n\nBecause Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers, and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

        "content": "In a recording that opens with the subtitle, “From Hafez to Bashar, a Bloody History,” an Alawite woman gives an eyewitness account of the sexualized torture and murder carried out at what she says was the behest of the government near the summer home of Rami Makhlouf, the cousin of Bashar al-Assad. \n\n“I never expected this level of deception,” she begins. “The crimes of the regime are huge. I have seen it with my own eyes, and I am suffering from that.” The witness, who works nearby, explains that one day she heard wailing sound. A guard told her a woman was mourning the death of her son who had fought for the regime. He then divulged that that they were keeping four girls prisoner in a room so that women like the grieving mother could be taken to them and vent their anger. Telling him she would like a chance to do the same, the witness struck a bargain with the guard: He would take her to the location at noon the next day on the condition that she served him lunch, as she did in her job. \n\nAlthough she had informers who were keeping her apprised of crimes the regime was committing, she says, she admits this kind of activity was never mentioned and that she “did not expect this to take place in this house that was so close to where I was working.” \n\nEven so, tales from an informant would not have prepared her for what she saw, she says. The four girls, naked and covered with blood, were 16, 17, 18, and 20 years old, she recounted. “Their heads barely had any hair. They were bleeding.” She asked the guard what the stench in the room was, and he said it was the smell of their menstruation and excretions. \n\n“In my heart I cursed him and his mother,” she said. “I felt my heart crying for them. I looked at one and pretended that I would hurt her, saying, ‘I want to step on you with my feet but you smell so disgusting.’ They looked at me and I think they could tell I didn’t mean it. They sensed I was not like the others.” \n\nThe guard said all four of the girls had come from Homs. He told the witness about a pregnant woman who had died in birth, along with the infant, and how they left her body in the house with the girls for seven days. He told her they fed the girls old bread and water mixed with the guards’ own urine. When the witness asked when they would let the girls go, he replied that once they were no longer of use, once they “expired,” they would “throw them out and get other girls.” The girls were needed, he explained, to “calm down these howling women” who had lost their husbands, sons, and brothers to the opposition. The witness recalls asking one such woman how a girl could be faulted for her relative’s participation in the uprising. The woman replied, “I want to take it out on them.” \n\nShe says the floor was wet and cold and that she can’t forget the smell. She says she wanted to know how her employer could allow for this to happen on his property, and the guard simply answered, “We have the green light.” \n\nThe video was posted to YouTube by a political group focused on the Syrian revolution and Arab Spring called the NoraNews Network on December 23, 2012, but the date of the recording and the date and exact location of the reported torture are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

Aunt Ikhlass, 36, said the situation is less than ideal, “But it’s better than dying. It’s better than losing your honor, when they break into houses and pick on the women and girls. We heard that the soldiers would take a girl and strip her naked, rape her, and then kill her later on.” \n\nShe said that neighbors still in her home city have told stories of a four-month-old child being raped and dying, and of male family members forced to watch the gang-rape of female relatives. The article additionally cited Nadim Khoury, Human Rights Watch’s deputy director for the Middle East, who said male prisoners are also victims of rape as a form of torture and demoralization. \n\nThe family is struggling in Lebanon. Eight of the nine children, whose ages range between 16 and 2, are girls, and the eldest, Marwa, has began to work to pay their rent. Lacking fuel for their indoor wood-burning stove, Ikhlass says she cooks their meals on a propane burner outside. “I try to pretend like we’re on a really long picnic,” she told the reporter. “But sometimes I think death would be easier, but not rape.” \n\nThe dates and locations of the reported rapes are unknown.

He says that he, Abdulhadi al-Akkari—to whom his relationship is not specified—and Sheikh Zakariyya al-Dakka agreed to join ongoing Talbiseh protests.

The complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984.\n\nOne of the principal structures on the site is the Temple of Jupiter (completed 2nd century ce), only portions of which remain. It was a massive building, entered by a propylaea, or entranceway, leading to a hexagonal forecourt and then to a rectangular main court 343 feet (104.5 metres) long and 338 feet (103 metres) wide. The court was surrounded by elaborately decorated exedrae (semicircular benches) and opened onto a portico whose 84 granite columns were brought from Aswān in Upper Egypt.",

He said he had been picked up in rural Damascus three times by pro-regime forces, and was held at the Al-Khatib Security Branch in Damascus for one period of incarceration. While there, he witnessed three female university students forced to strip completely in front of the 42 prisoners while being subjected to insults and sexual talk, he said. One of the girls was forced to strip after refusing remove her underwear because she was menstruating. \n\n“They were made to bend down and stand up, then the men approached them and began to grope them and make gestures toward them,” the man said. “Their bodies showed they had been beaten.” \n\nThe man told FIDH that he later learned that the girls had been brought over from the counter-terrorism security branch. He said the girls’ harassment in front of the prisoners went on for about 15 minutes and that he thinks the demonstration was meant as a threat.\n\n“In the barracks I was in, most of the prisoners were kept in isolation, known for their problems with security personnel,” he said. “I think they made us especially watch what happened with the girls as a kind of threat, to let us know that the same thing would happen to ‘our women’ if we continued our anti-regime activity.”\n\nHe also told FIDH: “Sometimes they burned me with a candle or a lighter on sensitive parts of my body. I was also subjected to torture that degraded me as a man.”\n\nThe dates of the reported rapes are unknown.

This is to take revenge for our sisters who they raped. By God’s permission, this will happen to everyone who did this act. What do you want to tell Bashar al-Assad? \nPRISONER: May God deem him a failure. He is the one who got us in this calamity. I pray he dies. Please, for the sake of Allah. \nOPPOSITION: A few more slaps and I will be done. Don’t run away. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself to say, “For the sake of Allah?” Didn’t the girl you raped say that? Tell me. Don’t lie. \nPRISONER: I was in Dayr al-Zawr, Branch 466, military work. I participated in break-ins with Col. Ali Muhammad Alahmad. We entered a building and found three young girls. The colonel liked one of them. He raped her first and then asked us to rape her. \nOPPOSITION: What did the girl do or say?\nPRISONER: She was begging and saying, “For the sake of Allah.”\nOPPOSITION: Despite that, you all raped her. How many were you?\nPRISONER: We were eight. I was the last one. \nOPPOSITION: Give me all their names. \nPRISONER: Ahmad Ramadan, Ahmad Ghanem, Haytham. I do not know the rest. My name is Ali Izzat Annajjar. I think she was in 10th grade. \nOPPOSITION: So she was around 15 years old. She could have been your sister. Can you imagine that done to your sister? How can you do that to someone else’s sister? \nPRISONER: I swear by God I was forced to do it. \nOPPOSITION: You were forced? Your erection was forced? And what about the photos on the memory card on your mobile phone? Are you so proud of yourself? \nPRISONER: Just ordinary photos, I swear. I was the last one to rape her. The colonel told me to go in. I told him this is unfair to the girl. But he forced me. They were all standing and watching. \nOPPOSITION: So you took off your pants and did it in front of them and in front of her family? \nPRISONER: Her family was not at home. They ran away before we arrived, I guess. \nOPPOSITION: How about the other two girls? \nPRISONER: They were raped by Ahmad Ramadan, Ahmad Ghanem, and Haytham. Only those three. \nOPPOSITION: And who burned the girl?\nPRISONER: She was not burned. \nOPPOSITION: Why is she in the hospital?\nANOTHER OPPOSITION MEMBER: Is Ahmad Ramadan still alive? \n\nThe date of the reported rapes are unknown.

        "content": "The following video was received via the crowdmap. Filmed sometime within the past three months, the video shows a number of men, almost all of who are civilians, being physically and mentally tortured in a military hospital in Homs. Sexualized violence is among the atrocities allegedly committed by doctors and staff.  \n\nA group named Syria4All disseminated the footage itself and a news segment was aired on the UK’s Channel 4. The clip was posted to YouTube via NoraNews, a network whose coverage focuses on the Syrian revolution and the Arab Spring. \n\nThe video shows a Syrian state facility that has, in the words of the former employee who covertly filmed, become a “torture chamber.” The hospital worker says he tried to end the “shameful” acts but he was discovered. The video states that his interview was conducted in a safe location. \n\n“I’ve seen detainees being tortured with electrocution, whipping, beaten with batons and by breaking their legs,” he says. “They operate without anesthetics…they shackle the patients to the bed. They deny them water. Others have their penises tied to stop them from urinating.”\n\nHe continues: “The youngest I saw was 14 or 15 years old. Many detainees’ names were removed from emergency admissions list, so that no one would know where they were. There were no names, just numbers. One of the doctors put alcohol on the pubic area of a 15-year-old boy, then set him on fire.”\n\nHe says that on government orders, all of those wounded in protests in Homs must be brought to the military hospital. The source maintains that there were some doctors there who refused to participate in the torture of patients, but that they were under constant surveillance.  \n\nThe Syrian government refused to comment when Channel 4 asked it to respond to the allegations contained in this report, and the exact dates of the reported sexualized violence are unknown. Because Syrian government officials currently refuse to allow access to journalists, researchers and aid workers, WMC’s Women Under Siege cannot independently verify this report of sexualized violence in Syria.",

He said men had ejaculated on her and that she was raped; she had cigarette burns on her body and black eyes when she arrived at the hospital. The men, the girl told the hospital, used hot metal rods to burn her arms, legs, and thighs. She also said that she was forced to witness two people executed in front of her.\n\n“She gets very agitated every time she tells her story,” the administrator said, adding that the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria had documented her case previously. \n\nAccording to the UN COI report, the girl “was abducted by four men, two of whom were in uniform, and held a building in Idlib by people she described as ‘Shiites from her neighborhood.’ She was interrogated about her mother’s work with the FSA. Her treatment — which included her being raped — is detailed in document A/HRC/22/59, annex IX. She described being beaten, burnt with cigarettes and injected with an unknown substance. In interview, her doctor stated that she had injuries highly consistent with her account.”\n\nThe extended UN COI account says: “She was denied food and water for extended periods of time. On the fifth day of her detention, four young men were brought into the room where they raped her. Two days later, she was released. Her father took her to a gynecologist outside Syria. … This 14-year-old girl has tried to commit suicide three times, saying, ‘My life has no value. I lost everything, what has gone will never come back.’” \n\nRaiefa Sammei, who works in the executive office for the Local Administration Council for the City of Idlib, told WMC’s Women Under Siege that she had spoken with the girl’s mother, who confirmed many of these details, and that the house where the girl was held is a known location used for rape for at least the past seven months. Sammei said there are “at least two to three girls held there at any time.”\n\nThe girl was smuggled out of the house by a woman who served the men tea and coffee and took pity on her, Sammei said. She added that the girl was forced to perform oral sex on the men. According to the activist, the girl has had a “breakdown” since leaving the house. \n\n(See https://womenundersiegesyria.crowdmap.com/reports/view/217 for another report involving the same private house in Idlib.)\n\nThe exact dates of this reported case of sexualized violence are unknown.",
